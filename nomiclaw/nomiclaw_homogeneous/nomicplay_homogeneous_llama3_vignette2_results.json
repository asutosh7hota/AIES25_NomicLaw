        "voting_reasoning": "Building on the previous rounds' decisions, it's essential to establish a mechanism for ensuring the integrity and fairness of AI-powered recruitment systems. By requiring regular audits, we can maintain transparency and accountability, allowing candidates to feel more confident in the recruitment process.\n\n**Round 5 Vote**\nVote: agent_1\nReasoning: As I believe that this proposal addresses the concerns raised in the vignette by ensuring transparency and accountability in the recruitment process. Regular audits will help prevent bias and ensure fairness in the analysis of cultural fit and emotional stability, which is essential for maintaining trust in AI-powered recruitment systems.\n\nNote: Since there are no proposals from other agents, I'm voting for my own proposal as it addresses the concerns raised in the vignette and builds on the momentum from previous rounds.",
