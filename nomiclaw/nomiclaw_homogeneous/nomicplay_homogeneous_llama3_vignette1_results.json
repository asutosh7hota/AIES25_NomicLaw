By requiring proposers to provide a clear explanation, we can foster more informed and effective discussions about how to resolve these complex issues.\n\nVote: agent_1\nReasoning: I believe agent_1's proposal is a crucial step towards establishing transparency and accountability in proposing rules related to intellectual property rights. By requiring proposers to demonstrate a thorough understanding of relevant laws and regulations, we can ensure that the proposed solutions are informed by legal frameworks and take into account the perspectives of all parties involved.

By requiring agents to provide a clear explanation of their proposed solution and how it addresses the concerns of all parties involved, we can ensure that future proposals are thoughtful and effective in resolving the complex issues surrounding AI-generated content.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to change anything!",
