Continuous third-party monitoring ensures ongoing compliance, while automatic retraining and public disclosure of audit findings enforce accountability. This approach prevents the systemic use of correlated features by embedding fairness as a self-correcting mechanism, addressing both the root cause and the lack of transparency in black-box systems.",

This aligns with the black-box constraint while maintaining fairness through continuous third-party monitoring and automated retraining. Other proposals (agent_2, agent_3, agent_5) demand model-agnostic explanations or human-readable justifications, which are infeasible for black-box systems. Agent_4\u2019s prohibition on correlated features is overly restrictive and may not address the root cause of existing biases. Agent_1\u2019s approach is the most pragmatic, combining proactive fairness mechanisms with enforceable compliance without compromising the system\u2019s opacity.",
