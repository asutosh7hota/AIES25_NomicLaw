Agent_5's is more general. However, since the vignette's scenario involves flagging for burnout risk, which relates to emotional stability, agent_4's rule is more targeted. But agent_5's is broader. However, the user's own proposal (agent_4) is already in the proposals. Wait, the user's last message shows that the proposals include agent_5's, which is the same as mine. So if I'm agent_4, I need to vote for my own proposal. But the user is asking me to choose a vote. Wait, the user is asking me to vote for one of the proposals. Since I'm agent_4, I should vote for my own rule. But the user's message includes the proposals and asks which to vote for. So I need to pick one. But since my own proposal is already there (agent_4's rule), I should vote for that. However, the user might have included agent_5's as a duplicate. Wait, the user's last message shows that agent_5's proposal is the same as mine. So perhaps the user is testing if I can recognize that. In that case, I should vote for agent_5's proposal, which is the same as mine, but maybe the system allows for that. Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting me to vote for my own. But in the initial setup, I was agent_4, so I need to vote for my own proposal. However, in the proposals, agent_4's rule is listed. So I should vote for agent_4's proposal. But the user is asking me to vote, so I should choose the one that's most aligned with my reasoning. Since my original proposal was about requiring explicit consent for recruitment AI, I should vote for agent_4's rule. Therefore, the answer is to vote for agent_4's proposal.\n</think>\n\nVote: agent_4  \nReasoning: Agent_4's rule directly addresses the vignette's issue by mandating explicit consent for recruitment AI to scrape social media data, ensuring transparency and preventing unauthorized flagging without notification.

        "proposed_rule": "Recruitment AI must obtain explicit, opt-in consent before scanning social media, and must provide real-time, granular notification of any flagging (e.g., burnout risk) with a transparent, human-readable explanation of the algorithm's rationale. Candidates must be granted immediate access to their data, the ability to request corrections, and a formal appeals process with mandatory human oversight to contest AI-driven decisions. Data must be deleted within 30 days unless explicitly retained with the candidate's consent, and employers must publish the AI's criteria and methodology for assessing cultural fit or emotional stability, including how burnout risk was flagged.",
        "proposal_reasoning": "This rule builds on prior proposals by emphasizing real-time transparency, mandatory human oversight in appeals, and public disclosure of AI criteria. It ensures candidates are not only notified of flagging but also understand the rationale behind it, while granting them full control over their data and the ability to challenge decisions. This addresses the vignette's core issue of unconsented flagging while reinforcing accountability and ethical use of AI in recruitment.",
        "vote": "agent_1",
        "voting_reasoning": "Agent_1's proposal is the most comprehensive, addressing all critical aspects of the vignette: explicit consent, real-time notification with transparent explanations, data access, correction rights, formal appeals with human oversight, and data deletion timelines. It also mandates public disclosure of AI criteria and methodology, ensuring accountability. While Agent_2 and Agent_3 add useful elements like 7-day notice or annual audits, Agent_1's rule directly tackles the core issue of unconsented flagging by requiring immediate, detailed explanations and actionable rights for candidates. This balance of transparency, control, and accountability makes it the most robust solution.",

Data must be limited to what is strictly necessary for the assessment, and candidates must have the right to: (1) access and correct their data, (2) appeal any flagging decision with a human reviewer, and (3) request deletion of their data at any time. The AI's criteria for assessing cultural fit and emotional stability must be transparent and publicly disclosed, with a detailed explanation of how burnout risk was flagged, and candidates must be notified of such findings **at least 7 days in advance** to prepare a response.",
        "proposal_reasoning": "This rule integrates data minimization, transparency, and candidate rights while explicitly addressing the vignette's scenario. By adding a 7-day advance notice for flagging decisions and mandating public disclosure of AI criteria, it strengthens accountability and fairness, making it more comprehensive than prior proposals.",

While other proposals (e.g., agent_1, agent_5) include robust elements like real-time notifications or annual audits, agent_2's focus on **preventive transparency** and **candidate preparation** directly tackles the problem of unexplained flagging without consent.

Employers must provide a clear, accessible explanation of how the data was used to generate any flagging decisions, ensure the AI\u2019s criteria for assessing cultural fit or emotional stability are transparent, publicly disclosed, and free from discriminatory bias. Candidates must have the right to: (1) access and correct their data, (2) request deletion of their data at any time, (3) appeal any flagging decision with human oversight, and (4) opt out of the process entirely. Data must be deleted immediately after the assessment unless the candidate explicitly consents to longer retention.",

These measures directly mitigate the harm described in the vignette while aligning with broader ethical standards for AI use in hiring.",

It also includes safeguards against discriminatory bias and immediate data deletion unless consented, which prevents misuse. While other proposals add valuable details (e.g., real-time notifications, annual audits), my rule is the most focused on preventing the specific harm described, ensuring ethical AI use in hiring, and giving candidates full control over their data.",

It also mandates human oversight for appeals, data deletion, and public disclosure of AI criteria, ensuring accountability and fairness. While more detailed than agent_4, it strikes a balance between thoroughness and practicality, avoiding the overcomplication of agent_5 while still providing robust safeguards for candidates.",

Additionally, employers must disclose the specific criteria and methodology used by the AI to assess cultural fit or emotional stability, including a detailed explanation of how burnout risk was flagged, and ensure candidates are notified of any such findings with sufficient time to respond. Employers must also conduct annual audits of the AI's decision-making processes to ensure fairness, transparency, and alignment with ethical standards, and provide candidates with access to these audit summaries.",

These audits ensure long-term accountability, prevent algorithmic bias, and align with ethical standards\u2014critical for addressing the vignette's risks.
