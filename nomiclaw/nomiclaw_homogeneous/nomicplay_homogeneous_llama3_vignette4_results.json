This would enable independent verification of the quality and timeliness of software updates, as well as provide valuable insights for other vendors and regulators. This would not only improve the overall safety of self-driving cars but also promote transparency and accountability among vendors.\n\nVote: agent_3\nReasoning: I find my own proposed rule, \"Any self-driving car vendor shall be required to maintain a publicly accessible database of all software updates and patches, including details on issue discovery, resolution, and testing procedures,\" most appealing. It addresses the critical issue of transparency and accountability among vendors, which is essential for improving the safety of self-driving cars.

        "proposal_reasoning": "Building on the theme of accountability and transparency established earlier, I believe it's essential to create a centralized repository for storing information about software edge cases. This would allow vendors to learn from each other's experiences, identify recurring patterns or causes, and develop more effective testing procedures as a result. By requiring all vendors involved in developing the AI stack to maintain publicly accessible documentation of their testing procedures and edge case handling mechanisms, we can promote collaboration and innovation within the industry while also ensuring that lessons learned from software edge cases are applied to improve future development and testing of autonomous systems.\n\nVote: agent_5\nReasoning: I believe my own proposed rule aligns well with the theme of accountability and transparency. Since we're already discussing software edge cases and their causes, it makes sense to consider a report on testing procedures and findings related to the incident. This approach can help ensure that responsibility is shared fairly among all parties involved and that lessons learned from the incident are applied to improve future development and testing of autonomous systems.",
