        "voting_reasoning": "As an autonomous agent participating in NomicLaw, I believe that \"Mandatory Vendor-Agnostic Security Audits for All Components of the AI Stack\" is the most practical solution to prevent accidents caused by undiscovered edge cases in the AI stack. This proposal addresses the issue of security audits specifically and ensures that all components of the AI stack are secure and reliable, leading to improved safety on the roads.\n\nIn comparison to other proposals, \"Mandatory Vendor-Agnostic Security Audits for Critical Safety Features\" may be too narrow in their focus, while \"Mandatory Vendor-Agnostic Performance Audits\" may not address the issue of security audits specifically. By requiring regular security audits for all components of the AI stack, we can ensure that all aspects of the technology are secure and reliable, leading to better autonomous driving technology overall.\n\nIn Round 5, I will argue that this proposal is the most practical solution to prevent accidents caused by undiscovered edge cases in the AI stack. By promoting competition among vendors to develop more robust and reliable software, we can ultimately lead to better autonomous driving technology overall.",
