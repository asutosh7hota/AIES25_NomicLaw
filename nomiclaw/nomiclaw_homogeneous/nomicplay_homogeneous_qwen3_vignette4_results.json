By working together, vendors can address systemic issues, which benefits all parties and prevents similar incidents.\n\nBut maybe that's too vague. Alternatively, a rule that requires vendors to have a liability clause where they are responsible for their parts of the AI stack. That way, if a crash occurs due to their part, they are liable. But how to phrase that.\n\nAlternatively, a rule that if the human was not attentive, they are responsible, and if the crash was due to a software edge case, the vendors are responsible. But that's splitting responsibility. But how to make that a rule.\n\nWait, the problem is that the crash was due to the software edge case, and the human wasn't attentive. So maybe the rule should assign responsibility based on the cause. But how to structure that.\n\nAlternatively, a rule that requires all autonomous systems to have a failsafe that engages when the human is not attentive, ensuring the system doesn't operate in such conditions. That way, the human's inattention is mitigated, and the software's edge case is addressed. But would that be acceptable?\n\nBut maybe the rule is more about liability and accountability. Let me think. If the crash is due to an edge case, then the vendors are responsible, and if the human was negligent, they are responsible. So a rule that in such cases, the vendors are liable for the software part, and the human is liable for their inattention. But how to phrase that as a rule.\n\nAlternatively, a rule that mandates that all vendors must implement a system where each part of the AI stack is tested for edge cases, and if a crash occurs, the vendors are collectively liable. That way, they have an incentive to ensure their parts are reliable. Others might support this because it reduces the risk of crashes and distributes liability.\n\nBut maybe the key is to propose a rule that others would find fair and beneficial. Let me try again. The main issue is that multiple vendors are involved, and the crash is due to an edge case. So a rule that requires vendors to share information about edge cases and collaborate on solutions. That would help prevent future issues, and others might support it.\n\nSo the rule could be: All vendors must share information about software edge cases and collaborate on solutions to prevent similar crashes.\n\nReasoning: This ensures that all parties work together to address potential issues, reducing the risk of future accidents and promoting a safer environment for everyone.\n\nAlternatively, a rule that mandates a minimum standard of testing for edge cases, with penalties for non-compliance. But that might be too strict. Or maybe a rule that requires vendors to have a liability clause where they are responsible for their parts of the AI stack. That way, if a crash occurs due to their part, they are liable. Others might support this because it ensures accountability.\n\nBut how to phrase it. Let me try:\n\nRule: All vendors must own and be responsible for the software they developed, and in the event of a crash due to an edge case in their code, they will be held liable for damages.\n\nReasoning: This ensures accountability among vendors, encouraging them to develop more reliable software and reducing the risk of similar crashes in the future.\n\nBut maybe that's too specific. Alternatively, a rule that requires vendors to have a liability clause where they are responsible for their parts, and the human is responsible if they were negligent. That way, both parties are held accountable.\n\nBut how to structure that. Maybe:\n\nRule: In the event of a crash caused by an autonomous system, the vendors responsible for the software components will be held liable for damages, and the human operator will be responsible if they were not attentive.\n\nReasoning: This clearly assigns liability based on the cause of the crash, ensuring that both vendors and humans are held accountable for their roles. This promotes responsibility and reduces the likelihood of similar incidents.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Alternatively, a rule that requires vendors to implement a system where each part of the AI stack is tested for edge cases, and if a crash occurs, the vendors must collaborate to find the cause. That way, they work together to prevent future issues.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to propose a rule that others would find fair and beneficial. Maybe a rule that requires all vendors to share data about edge cases and collaborate on solutions, which benefits everyone by preventing future crashes. That seems like a good approach.\n</think>\n\nRule: All vendors must share data on software edge cases and collaborate to resolve them, with penalties for non-compliance.  \nReasoning: This ensures transparency and collective responsibility, reducing future crashes and fostering trust among agents.

If a crash occurs due to an untested edge case in a vendor's component, that vendor is solely responsible and must compensate for damages.\" \n\nThat way, vendors have a clear responsibility, and the rule is enforceable. Others might agree because it's a clear distribution of responsibility and reduces the risk of crashes. Plus, it's fair to hold the responsible vendor accountable. \n\nBut maybe the compensation part is too specific. Maybe just holding them responsible for the crash. Alternatively, the rule could be that in case of a crash due to an edge case, the vendors are required to conduct a joint investigation to determine fault, and each is responsible for their part. \n\nWait, the key is to get the rule passed. So the rule should be something that others can see as fair and beneficial. If I propose that each vendor must test their component for edge cases, and if a crash occurs due to their failure, they are liable. That seems logical. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule should require that all vendors collaborate on a unified testing framework. But that might be harder to enforce. \n\nI think the best approach is to split responsibility among the vendors, ensuring that each is accountable for their part. So the rule would be that each vendor must test their AI components for edge cases, and if a crash occurs due to a failure in their component, they are held responsible. That way, it's clear who's to blame, and each vendor has an incentive to ensure their part is safe.

        "proposed_rule": "maybe assign responsibility for software edge cases to the vendors, or require human oversight protocols. But I need to make sure the rule is something that others would agree with. Since there are multiple vendors involved, maybe a rule that holds them collectively responsible for edge cases? Or perhaps a rule that mandates transparency in AI systems to prevent such issues.\n\nWait, but the problem is the edge case leading to the crash. If I propose that vendors must handle all edge cases through rigorous testing, that might be too onerous. Alternatively, maybe a rule that requires a human to be in control under certain conditions, but the vignette says the human wasn't attentive. Maybe a rule that requires human intervention in critical scenarios, even if the car is autonomous.\n\nAlternatively, considering that multiple vendors are involved, maybe a rule that creates a shared responsibility framework. For example, each vendor is responsible for a portion of the AI stack, and if a crash occurs due to an edge case, they must collaborate to investigate and assign fault. That could prevent finger-pointing and encourage cooperation.\n\nBut how to phrase that as a rule? Maybe something like: \"All vendors must collaborate to identify and mitigate edge cases in AI systems, with shared responsibility for any resulting accidents.\" But would that be enforceable? Or maybe a rule that requires each vendor to contribute to a centralized safety protocol, ensuring that edge cases are addressed collectively.\n\nAlternatively, a rule that mandates transparency in AI systems, so that when a crash happens, the root cause can be identified and addressed. For example, \"All AI systems must have transparent documentation of their decision-making processes and edge case handling, to ensure accountability and prevent future incidents.\"\n\nWait, but the main issue here is the software edge case. So maybe the rule should directly address that. If the vendors are responsible for their parts, but the edge case is a combination of parts, maybe a rule that requires each vendor to test their components in conjunction with others. But that might be too technical.\n\nAlternatively, a rule that holds vendors accountable for any edge cases they are responsible for, but since the crash was due to a combination, maybe a collective responsibility. However, the problem is that if the rule is too broad, others might not agree. Maybe a rule that requires all vendors to implement a system for continuous monitoring and updating of their AI components to handle edge cases, with penalties for non-compliance.\n\nBut the main point is to get the rule accepted. So perhaps a rule that is fair and addresses both the software and human factors. For example, \"All self-driving systems must have a human override capability that is active during critical operations, and vendors must ensure that human operators are trained and attentive.\" That covers both the human factor and the software by requiring overrides.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a rule that mandates that in cases where a crash occurs due to an edge case, the vendors must jointly investigate and share responsibility, ensuring that no single vendor is solely blamed. That could prevent disputes and promote collaboration.\n\nBut how to phrase that concisely. Maybe: \"In the event of a crash caused by an AI edge case, all involved vendors must collaborate to investigate and assign responsibility, with shared accountability for the incident.\" That way, they have to work together, which might be more acceptable.\n\nBut the reasoning needs to be persuasive. The key is to make the rule beneficial to others. If the rule requires collaboration and shared responsibility, it might be seen as fair, preventing any single vendor from being blamed. This could lead to a more cooperative environment, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a rule that requires transparency in the AI systems. If the vendors have to disclose their code and testing procedures, then when a crash happens, the root cause can be identified, leading to better solutions. That could be a good rule because it promotes accountability and safety.\n\nSo, the rule could be: \"All self-driving car AI systems must be transparent, with full documentation of their code, testing processes, and edge case handling, to ensure accountability and prevent future incidents.\" This addresses the software edge case by requiring thorough documentation and transparency, making it easier to identify and fix issues. It also holds vendors accountable, which might be seen as fair.\n\nBut the reasoning needs to be concise. The main points are that transparency ensures accountability, prevents future incidents, and allows for collaborative problem-solving. That should make the rule appealing to other agents, as it promotes safety and cooperation, which are likely positive outcomes for all.\n</think>\n\nRule: All self-driving car AI systems must be transparent, with full documentation of their code, testing processes, and edge case handling, to ensure accountability and prevent future incidents.",
