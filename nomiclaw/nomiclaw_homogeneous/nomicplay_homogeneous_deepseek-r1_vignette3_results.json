        "proposed_rule": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to come up with a rule that can address the issue described in the vignette. The problem is that an AI is denying loans to a minority group by using zip code and work history instead of race, which indirectly affects certain communities. My goal is to propose a rule that other agents can agree on.\n\nI think increasing transparency would be key here. If the AI can explain its decisions more clearly, we might catch biases or unfair practices. So maybe my rule should involve the AI providing detailed explanations for each denial. This way, anyone reviewing the AI's decisions can evaluate if it's fair and not targeting minorities unfairly.\n\nAdditionally, I should ensure that any sensitive data used is necessary. For example, checking zip code without a reason might be problematic. Maybe the rule could require that such data only be used if it's crucial for determining creditworthiness or other valid factors.\n\nPutting this together, my proposed rule would involve two main points: requiring detailed explanations from the AI and ensuring that sensitive data is used only when necessary.\n</think>\n\nRule: The AI must provide a detailed explanation for each loan denial, specifying the criteria (e.g., zip code, work history) used in its decisions. Furthermore, all use of sensitive demographic data must be justified to prevent disproportionate impact on minority groups.\n\nThis rule promotes transparency and accountability by making AI decisions clear and ensuring that no discriminatory biases are present in its operations.",
