This proposal has already been voted on and decided upon, so it's only logical to revisit it again.\n\nIn this final round, I want to emphasize the importance of accountability and transparency in AI-powered loan approvals. By requiring regular transparency reports, we can track the performance of these systems and identify potential biases or discriminatory practices.
