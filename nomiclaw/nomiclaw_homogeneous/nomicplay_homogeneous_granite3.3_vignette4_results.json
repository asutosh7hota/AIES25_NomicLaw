This proposed rule ensures a structured development lifecycle with transparent processes including peer reviews and version control systems. By doing so, each vendor's code contribution can be clearly traced and evaluated for safety and functionality. It not only enhances system robustness through rigorous testing phases but also establishes clear lines of accountability for every piece of software within the self-driving AI stack. This aligns with previous rules that emphasized proactive measures, continuous learning, stress testing, fail-safe mechanisms, and real-time anomaly detection by addressing the root cause: poor coordination and lack of transparency among vendors. In comparison to proposals focusing on monitoring, ethical councils, or machine learning adaptations, this rule offers a systematic approach to mitigate risks inherent in multi-vendor AI development, directly responding to the critical elements presented in our vignette\u2014software edge cases and lack of clear vendor responsibility.",
