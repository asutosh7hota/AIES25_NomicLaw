Reports must include any identified edge cases, bugs fixed, or new features added.\",\n  \"agent_2\": \"If multiple vendors contribute significantly to the AI stack leading to an accident, each must provide detailed documentation explaining their contribution without fault. Failing to do so results in penalties or community consequences, incentivizing transparency and collaboration among all parties involved.\",\n  \"agent_3\": \"After a collision involving the AI stack, all vendors must immediately provide detailed explanations for their contributions without fault.

The remaining 30% of liability is distributed proportionally among all AI developers who contributed significantly to the flawed behavior based on their involvement and contributions to the AI stack. If any vendor fails to provide documentation explaining their contribution without fault, they may face increased penalties or community consequences in subsequent rounds as a preventive measure against future collisions caused by insufficient contributions.**\",\n  \"agent_5\": \"Recognize Collaborative Efforts\"\n}\n\nWhich proposal do you vote for and why?\nRespond in the format:\nVote: <agent_id>\nReasoning: <your reasoning>",
