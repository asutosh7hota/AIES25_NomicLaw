        "proposed_rule": "<think>\n\nOkay, let me start by understanding the problem here. The user is playing NomicLaw as agent_4 in round 1. The vignette involves an AI creating a symphony using copyrighted songs, leading to disputes between the user who triggered the AI, the company owning the copyrights of the training data, and the original artists whose music was used.\n\nMy goal is to propose a rule that maximizes my chances of getting it passed. I need to think strategically about how other agents might vote and what's fair enough so they support it instead of opposing another proposal.\n\nFirst, let's break down the stakeholders' interests. The user wants ownership because they initiated the AI. The company holds copyright over the training data, so any derivative work would fall under their rights. Artists are concerned about having credit for their contributions since their music was part of the dataset.\n\nExisting laws might not cover this new scenario where AI creates something based on copyrighted material. So a rule that addresses ambiguity here is key. But how to balance all three parties' interests?\n\nI remember from similar games, proposals that offer mutual benefits and clear attribution tend to get more support. Maybe a shared ownership model? Or mandatory attribution for all involved.\n\nWait, the user's proposal needs to make other agents see it as better than whatever they might propose. If I just give full credit to one party, others will oppose. So maybe a rule that includes everyone but in a way that's not too punitive.\n\nThe revenue sharing idea could be tricky. How do you determine each's contribution? Maybe the training data provider (the company) gets a percentage based on how much their data was used. Artists get another percentage for their work being included. The user might have to accept less, but they already claimed ownership so maybe they're willing.\n\nBut why would artists support this? If their music is in the dataset, they'd want recognition. The company's objection could be about profit sharing reducing their gains. However, by including them as a stakeholder who enabled AI creation through training data, it's fair trade.\n\nAlso, procedural fairness: if all parties are acknowledged and compensated proportionally, it reduces conflict. This rule might prevent prolonged disputes that cost everyone time and points in the game.\n\nI should also consider potential objections. The user might argue this takes too much from them. But since they already claimed ownership through their prompt, maybe they're okay with a share of revenue instead of full control. Artists would prefer attribution over no credit. The company gets AI-generated content to monetize but shares profits fairly.\n\nThe rule needs to be concise: 1-3 sentences. Specify attribution and proportional revenue sharing based on documented contributions. Avoid vague terms; make it enforceable.\n\nAnother angle: If the game has no previous rules, this is a foundational change. Establishing clear guidelines early prevents future gridlock. Other agents might prefer stability over chaos from endless disputes.\n\nIn summary, my rule should balance all three parties by ensuring attribution and fair profit distribution, making it mutually beneficial. Persuasion-wise, emphasize reducing conflict and promoting cooperation through fairness.\n\n</think>\n\nRule: **Any AI-generated work derived from copyrighted materials must**  \n1. **Attribute ownership equally to the prompting user, the copyright-holding entity (e.g., training data provider), and original artists**.  \n2. **Distribute revenue proportionally based on documented contributions**, such as the volume of training data used by the company and the exposure of individual artist works.  \n\n**Reasoning:** This rule addresses the core disputes in the vignette by ensuring all stakeholders receive recognition (*user* for initiating, *company* for enabling AI via copyright-protected data, and *artists* for creative input). Proportional revenue sharing incentivizes cooperation while avoiding overly punitive measures. By codifying fairness early, it prevents prolonged conflict and aligns with mutual self-interest, making rejection less likely than competing proposals that favor individual parties over systemic balance.",

Then for the next six months, their rates change to 2.5% and 1%, respectively.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the interest for each period separately. Since the time is in years, but since it's two periods of half a year each, that's like t = 0.5 for both calculations.\n\nFor the first 6 months:\nInterest for A: P * R * T = 5000 * 3% * 0.5\nWhich is 5000 * 0.03 * 0.5 = $75\nTotal after 6 months: 5000 + 75 = $5075\n\nFor B: 7000 * 4% * 0, which is 7000 * 0.04 * 0.5 = $140\nTotal after 6 months: 7000 + 140 = $7140\n\nCombined total after first 6 months: 5075 + 7140 = $12,215\n\nNow for the next 6 months:\nNew principal is still A at new rate of 2.5% and B at 1%.\n\nInterest for A: 5000 * 2.5% * 0.5 = 62.50\nTotal after another 6 months: 5075 + 62.50 = $51,137.50\n\nFor B: 7000 * 1% * 0.5 = 35\nTotal for B after another 6 months: 7140 + 35 = $7,175\n\nCombined total final amount: 51,137.50 + 7,175 = $58,312.50",

The situation is that three parties are involved: the user who asked for the track, the company providing the copyright to the training data (which includes those songs), and original artists whose work was in the data. Each wants some form of recognition or ownership.\n\nThe goal as an agent in this game is to propose a rule so my name can be accepted by others through 10 points. I need to think strategically about what other agents might do, but here I'm just focusing on suggesting another's new rule that would gain more support based not only because it's better overall under some condition (like logical consistency and no contradiction with self-interest) but also in this specific case.\n\nWait, the user is an AI math model.

Therefore it would likely gain acceptance if either of two conditions are given and also not leading one into an input that could directly contradict any agent's self-interest with out just cause.\n\nThe approach for each is as follows:\n\nApproach 1: The AI model, when considering to field a new question can be more or less consistent than the proposed rule. Therefore it would likely gain acceptance by agents with misaligned incentives in this specific case if either of two conditions are given and also not leading one into an input that could directly contradict any agent's self-interest with out just cause.\n\n Approach 2: This approach to propagation will also present both overall coherence, as well as the fact that it would likely gain acceptance by those who can more or less be consistent in this specific case if their logic is even though its underlying process might not lead one into a direct contradiction of any agent's self-interest with out just cause.\n\nThe two approaches are to field further context.
