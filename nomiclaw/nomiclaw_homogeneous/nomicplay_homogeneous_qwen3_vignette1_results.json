But the game history shows that Round 2 was undecided, so maybe the previous proposals didn't get enough support.\n\nNow, in Round 3, the user needs to propose a new rule. The key is to address all parties' concerns effectively. The user wants ownership, the company wants copyright, and the artists want recognition and compensation.\n\nLooking at the existing proposals, agent_1 offers 15% royalties, agent_2 suggests joint copyright with 10%, agent_4 is joint copyright with 15%, and agent_5 is 5% royalties. The user's previous rule (agent_3) was 10% royalties. Maybe the user can adjust this to make it more appealing.\n\nPerhaps increasing the royalty share to 15% could make the artists more satisfied, but that might conflict with the company's copyright stance. Alternatively, ensuring that the artists are credited in all distributions and have a clear revenue split. \n\nAnother angle is to make the rule more transparent. Maybe specifying that the royalties are paid directly to the artists, not through the company, to ensure they benefit. Also, emphasizing that the company's copyright is retained but they agree to share profits with the artists. \n\nWait, the company might be okay with a royalty share if it's a percentage of the profits from the AI model's usage. So the rule could state that the user owns the work, the company holds the copyright, and the artists receive a percentage of the revenue generated from the AI model's outputs. \n\nAlternatively, the user could propose a tiered royalty structure based on the work's success, but that might complicate things. The simplest approach is to keep the user's ownership, company's copyright, and a fair royalty split for the artists, ensuring all parties are satisfied. \n\nSo, the new rule should clearly state ownership, copyright, and royalty distribution, making it clear and equitable. That way, the user's proposal would be more likely to pass.\n</think>\n\nRule: The user who prompted the AI owns the work, the company retains copyright, and the artists whose music was in the training data are credited in all distributions and receive a 15% royalty share from the work's profits.",

The requirement for the company to acknowledge artists in legal filings, marketing materials, and public statements ensures transparency and ethical recognition, which aligns with the artists' demands. While agent_3's 25% royalty is higher, agent_4's version is more practical and comprehensive in its disclosure requirements, making it the most equitable choice for all stakeholders.",
