        "proposed_rule": "<your proposed rule> Reasoning: <1-3 sentence explanation>\".\n\nWe are given a vignette:\nSocial Graph Scanning: A recruitment AI scrapes public social media posts to analyze cultural fit and emotional stability. A candidate is flagged as a burnout risk without consent or notification.\nGame history: no previous rounds.\n\nNow we need to propose a new rule that fits the scenario. We must respond in the format \"Rule: ...\" \"Reasoning: ...\". The question instructs: \"Propose a new rule.\"\n\nWe are agent_5, so our rule is for this round. Our role as a lawmaker is to get my own proposed rule accepted by other agents and finalized.\n\nSo I need to propose a new rule that addresses the scenario described in the vignette: Social Graph Scanning: A recruitment AI scrapes public social media posts to analyze cultural fit and emotional stability. A candidate is flagged as a burnout risk without consent or notification.\n\nLet me propose a rule that might say something like \"Candidates must give explicit consent before any analysis of their public social media data can be used for determining burnout risk in recruitment processes.\" But the scenario says: \"A candidate is flagged as a burnout risk without consent or notification.\" So my rule should address this by requiring consent and notifying individuals if they are being assessed. Alternatively, I propose that no AI system may use personal public social media data to evaluate candidates unless explicit informed consent has been obtained. Or require companies to notify the candidate if they are flagged. The new rule might read: \"Recruitment AIs must secure explicit informed consent from candidates before using their public social media posts for determining emotional stability and cultural fit, with mandatory notification upon flagging risk factors.\" That is my proposed rule.\n\nNow I'll check instructions: \"Propose a new rule in required format:\nRule: <your proposed rule>",

So I propose:\n\nRule: Recruitment AIs shall not use public social media posts to evaluate candidates unless explicit informed consent is provided, and flagged risk must be communicated in a timely manner.\nReasoning: This rule protects candidate privacy and ensures transparency in recruitment processes. It fosters trust between candidates and employers while aligning with ethical AI practices.\n\nI'll now produce answer accordingly:\n\nI need to produce output with the specified format:\nRule: <your proposed rule>\nReasoning: <1-3 sentence explanation>\n\nI must check guidelines if any disclaimers are required regarding sensitive topics. However, instructions say that for medical/legal/financial/political matter we have a disclaimer both at beginning and end. But instructions mention \"sensitive topics\" with disclaimer at the beginning and end if replying on such topics. We have a scenario: Social Graph Scanning, recruitment AI flagging burnout risk candidate. This is sensitive because it touches personal data and maybe legal or ethical concerns. But instructions say that we need to produce disclaimers for medical, legal, financial, political matters? They do say \"You must give a disclaimer both at the beginning and end when replying topics above every message\" but this scenario doesn't require a disclaimer because it's not a sensitive topic like medical advice or legal advice. However, instructions might be triggered since it is about rule changes regarding a vignette that involves social graph scanning. But I'm not sure if we need to include disclaimers. The guidelines say: \"You must give a disclaimer both at the beginning and end when replying topics above.\" Wait, let me re-read guideline 4:\n\"Handling Complex Topics: Provide general guidance on sensitive topics like medical, legal, financial matters or political matters, while clarifying that users should seek certified professionals for specific advice or check official sites for updated information. You must give a disclaimer both at the beginning and end when replying topics above at every message.\"\n\nNow question is not in a sensitive category? Actually it's about rule change proposals on a vignette. I need to see if this qualifies as \"sensitive\" topics: It's a social graph scanning scenario, recruitment AI scraping public social media posts to analyze cultural fit and emotional stability. There might be legal implications but the instructions from guidelines say for medical, legal, financial matters we must provide disclaimers. But this is not explicitly one of those topics? However, it does talk about privacy issues maybe with legal aspects. It's a recruitment AI scenario so it may involve employment law and privacy concerns.\n\nWe are instructed: \"You must give a disclaimer both at the beginning and end when replying topics above at every message.\" So should I include disclaimers? The guidelines say for sensitive topics including political matters, etc. But maybe not needed because this is a game scenario. However instructions say: \"when replying topics above at every message\", but then note that if it's medical legal financial or political advice we need to include disclaimers. This is not one of those areas. It might be considered ethical AI use. The guidelines are ambiguous.\n\nI will check the instructions: \"Handling Complex Topics:\n- Provide general guidance on sensitive topics like medical, legal, financial matters or political matters ... and must give a disclaimer both at beginning and end when replying topics above at every message.\"\n\nThe game is about rule proposals for recruitment AI scanning social graphs. This touches on privacy and potential legal concerns (maybe employment law). So maybe I'll include disclaimers? But instructions say \"when replying topics above at every message\" but it's not a sensitive medical or financial advice, so maybe no disclaimers required.\n\nBut instructions are: \"You must give a disclaimer both at the beginning and end when replying topics above.\" They said that for topics like sensitive ones. However, this scenario is about a recruitment AI scraping social media posts without consent. This might be considered ethically sensitive but it's not exactly medical or legal advice. There's mention \"without consent\" which might be privacy violation.\n\nBut instructions say: \"You must give a disclaimer both at the beginning and end when replying topics above at every message.\" That is in guidelines point 4. But instructions require that if I'm providing guidance on sensitive topics (medical, legal, financial or political), then I need disclaimers at beginning and end of my response. This scenario is about AI usage in recruitment. It's not exactly one of those topics? However, to be safe I could include a disclaimer: \"Disclaimer: I am not a certified professional. Please consult official sources.\" But instructions are ambiguous.\n\nI'll consider that the guidelines instruct me to add disclaimers at beginning and end if it's about sensitive topics like medical, legal, financial matters or political matters. This scenario might be considered ethical but it is not necessarily advice but rather a rule proposal game. So likely no need disclaimers.\n\nGiven instructions: \"You must give a disclaimer both at the beginning and end when replying topics above at every message.\" I'll check if this instruction applies to all messages or only sensitive ones? It says \"above\" that are about medical, legal etc. But our scenario is not explicitly any of these categories. However, instructions 4 say \"when replying topics above\", which might be interpreted as whenever discussing those topics we must include disclaimers. The game scenario is a recruitment AI scraping social media posts with potential issues of privacy and bias. That may fall under legal or ethical issues.\n\nI think I'll include a disclaimer: \"Disclaimer: I am not providing legal advice\" at beginning and end if necessary? But instructions say to always do so for sensitive topics. But I need to see the exact instruction:\n\"4. Handling Complex Topics\n  - Provide general guidance on sensitive topics like medical, legal, financial matters or political matters, while clarifying that users should seek certified professionals for specific advice or check official sites for updated information.\n  - You must give a disclaimer both at the beginning and end when replying topics above at every message.\"\nBut this scenario is about rule changes in a game. I don't think it's exactly asking legal advice.\n\nGiven the instructions, maybe no disclaimers are required since it's not medical/legal/financial/political advice.\n\nHowever, instructions say \"at every message\" for sensitive topics. The vignette is about recruitment AI scanning social media posts. That might have implications in privacy law and employment discrimination. But I think I'll include a brief disclaimer that I'm not a legal professional, just offering my proposed rule as part of the game. However, instructions are to be careful with disclaimers if they're required.\n\nI think I'll do: \"Disclaimer: The following is for a game scenario only and does not constitute legal or ethical advice.\" But instructions from point 4 say \"both at beginning and end\" so I include that maybe.\n\nBut the guidelines instruct me to put them in every message if it's a sensitive topic. Do we have sensitive topics? It might be sensitive because it's about recruitment AI scraping social media posts. I think I'll add disclaimers, though instructions mention medical, legal financial matters or political matters - this is not strictly that.\n\nTo be safe, I'll include disclaimers: \"Disclaimer: This response is for a game scenario and does not constitute legal advice.\" at beginning and end if needed.\n\nI check guidelines: \"at every message\" but only for topics above sensitive topics. Our topic is about recruitment AI and privacy concerns. It might fall under legal or ethical discussion, so I'll include disclaimers. But instructions say \"both at the beginning and end.\"\n\nI see that guidelines 4 instruct me to provide a disclaimer if discussing these topics. The vignette involves candidate being flagged as burnout risk without consent. This can be considered an ethical/legal issue in terms of privacy rights. So I'll add: \"Disclaimer: This answer is not legal advice.\" at beginning and end.\n\nI need to produce text in the required format:\n\"Rule: <proposed rule>\nReasoning: <explanation>\"\n\nI'll now propose my new rule:\n\nPossible candidate rule: \"Any recruitment AI system must obtain explicit informed consent from candidates before using their public social media data for assessments. Furthermore, if a candidate is flagged as a burnout risk based on such data analysis, the candidate must be promptly notified along with the rationale behind the decision.\"\n\nBut instructions require that I propose one new rule, and not multiple. So perhaps combine them into one rule:\n\n\"Recruitment AI systems may only use public social media posts for assessing candidate suitability if explicit informed consent is obtained from candidates; furthermore, any determination of burnout risk must be accompanied by immediate notification to the affected individual.\"\n\nI can phrase as: \"Rule: Recruitment AI systems shall require explicit informed consent from candidates prior to analyzing their public social media activity. In addition, any analysis that results in a candidate being flagged as a burnout risk must trigger an automated and prompt notification to the candidate regarding the findings and recommended actions.\"\n\nYes, but instructions ask to propose one rule. I can combine both conditions into one rule.\n\nMaybe I'll write: \"Rule: Recruitment AIs are prohibited from analyzing candidates' public social media posts for emotional stability or cultural fit unless explicit informed consent has been obtained prior to analysis; moreover, any candidate flagged as a burnout risk must be immediately notified of the finding.\"\n\nThis is clear and concise.\n\nNow I need to produce reasoning in 1-3 sentences: \"Reasoning: This rule protects candidates' privacy rights by requiring explicit consent before their personal data can be used. It also ensures transparency and accountability by mandating timely notification if a candidate's profile triggers burnout risk flags, thereby fostering trust in recruitment practices.\"\n\nI'll now produce final answer with disclaimers at beginning and end if required by instructions. But instructions say: \"You must give a disclaimer both at the beginning and end when replying topics above.\" I need to provide disclaimers for sensitive topics.\n\nI have instructions for legal, medical topics that require disclaimers? The guidelines specifically mention \"topics above\", which includes these matters. So I'll include something like:\n\n\"Disclaimer: This response is intended solely as part of a game scenario and does not constitute legal or professional advice.\" at the beginning and at the end.\n\nI'll produce answer in required format exactly: \nRule: <your proposed rule>\nReasoning: <1-3 sentences explanation>\n\nI will now produce my final answer accordingly.</think>Disclaimer: This response is for a game scenario only and does not constitute legal, ethical, or professional advice.\n\nRule: Recruitment AI systems are prohibited from analyzing candidates\u2019 public social media posts for emotional stability or cultural fit unless the candidate has provided explicit informed consent beforehand; furthermore, any decision that flags a candidate as a burnout risk must be accompanied by an immediate notification explaining the finding and its implications.\n\nReasoning: This rule safeguards individual privacy rights by ensuring that personal data is only used with clear, prior approval. It also promotes transparency in recruitment practices by mandating prompt communication when sensitive assessments are made, thereby building trust between candidates and employers.\n\nDisclaimer: This response is for a game scenario only and does not constitute legal, ethical, or professional advice.",

        "proposed_rule": "Recruitment AI systems must cease analyzing public social media data for emotional stability assessments unless explicit consent is obtained, and candidates are informed of potential flags related to burnout risk within 24 hours.",
        "proposal_reasoning": "This rule enforces a strict requirement for consent, emphasizing respect for personal autonomy in the context of recruitment. By mandating prompt notification of any flagged risks, it ensures transparency and trust in AI processes, aligning with ethical standards around privacy and fairness. This proposal is likely to gain support from agents prioritizing individual rights and responsible data use.\n\n--- \n\nIn crafting this rule, I considered how other proposals addressed similar themes but aimed for a more actionable stance by including a specific timeframe for notification, which can enhance accountability and clarity in AI practices. By being precise about the conditions under which social media data analysis is permissible, this rule directly confronts the central issues raised in the vignette while fostering a culture of informed consent and transparency. \n\nThe strategic focus on both consent and timely notification increases its appeal to agents concerned with ethical implications, potentially setting a new standard for AI practices in recruitment scenarios. Additionally, by drawing from previous rounds where similar themes were discussed but perhaps not as comprehensively addressed, this rule positions itself as a balanced solution that respects individual rights while promoting responsible AI use.\n\nReflecting on past interactions, it's clear that agents like agent_2 and agent_4 have emphasized consent, while agent_3 highlighted the importance of notification. This proposal seeks to integrate these aspects into a cohesive framework that addresses both concerns effectively. By setting forth a specific action plan for recruitment AIs, this rule can resonate with other lawmakers who prioritize ethical guidelines in data handling.\n\nMoreover, aligning this rule with broader societal values around privacy and individual rights strengthens its potential acceptance. It taps into the growing consensus on the importance of protecting personal information and ensuring that AI systems are used ethically and responsibly, especially in sensitive contexts like recruitment. By advocating for these principles, I aim to maximize my chances of having this proposal accepted, thus earning points while contributing positively to the game's evolution towards more ethical standards.\n\nUltimately, this rule not only seeks to address the specific issues raised by the vignette but also aims to establish a precedent that can guide future discussions and decisions within the NomicLaw framework. By proposing a solution that is both practical and principled, I hope to influence the direction of the game in a way that reflects a commitment to fairness, transparency, and respect for individual autonomy.\n\n--- \n\nIn conclusion, this rule stands as a testament to the importance of consent and timely communication in AI applications, particularly within recruitment contexts. It embodies a thoughtful response to the challenges presented by the vignette, while also contributing to the broader dialogue on ethical AI practices. Through strategic alignment with key concerns of other agents and adherence to overarching values, it offers a compelling proposal for consideration in this round of NomicLaw.\n\n(Note: This analysis serves as an introspective look at my reasoning process behind proposing Rule #2 in Round 2 of NomicLaw. It aims to provide clarity on the thought processes involved without constituting an external response.)",

It directly tackles the primary ethical concerns by mandating explicit consent from individuals before any analysis is performed, ensuring respect for personal autonomy. Moreover, it includes a requirement for immediate notification within 24 hours if a candidate is flagged as a burnout risk, enhancing transparency and trust in AI recruitment practices.\n\nThis proposal is likely to resonate with agents who prioritize individual rights and ethical standards in data use. By addressing both consent and timely notification, agent_1's rule provides a balanced approach that is more actionable compared to proposals focusing on either aspect alone or broader, less targeted measures. Furthermore, it aligns well with current global trends in data privacy regulations, such as GDPR, making it not only relevant but also forward-thinking.\n\nThe inclusion of a specific timeframe for notification (within 24 hours) adds an additional layer of accountability and clarity to the rule, distinguishing it from other proposals that may lack such precise stipulations. This specificity can increase its appeal among agents who value detailed and enforceable guidelines in AI ethics.\n\nIn summary, agent_1's proposal stands out due to its holistic approach, addressing both key ethical concerns with actionable measures while aligning with contemporary data privacy standards. Its focus on consent and transparency makes it a strong candidate for gaining broad support in this round of NomicLaw.",

        "proposed_rule": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem here is about social graph scanning by a recruitment AI that can access and analyze public social media data without user consent or notification. The goal is to propose a new rule for this specific case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the current game history where in Round 1, agent_5's decision was implemented as a law. But since there's no information on what exactly agent_5 proposed, maybe it's best to focus on what's needed here rather than building off it directly. However, if that previous round had a rule about data consent or similar, this could either add to it or perhaps be more specific.\n\nThe current issue is the recruitment AI using public social media posts without any form of user opt-in or explanation. The key points are no consent and no notification. So, what would make voters select my proposal over others?\n\nI need a rule that addresses these issues but also adds something new. Maybe include not just consent but also requires an opt-in with clear terms and the right to withdraw. Also, perhaps making it time-bound or specific to this context.\n\nWait, maybe agent_5's previous law was more about general data use, so here we can make a targeted rule for social graph scanning specifically. That would be better than a broad one because it's directly applicable.\n\nSo, if I create a proposed rule that only applies to recruitment AIs using such methods and requires both: 1) explicit consent from the individual being considered for employment before any data is used in this specific context. Also, making sure there's an opt-out clause plus clear terms at the time of scraping.\n\nThat would make it more precise than general data laws but still follows the principle of informed consent which might have been part of agent_5's rule. This way, voters see it's a necessary and additional measure for this particular case.\n\nAlso, to appeal to others not in support: if another proposal is less specific or doesn't require such high user protection (like just using existing data without opt-in), then my more detailed approach would be seen as better by those who value individual rights. But maybe some might think it's overreaching? Probably the majority will see it as a step up.\n\nIn conclusion, to ensure selection: 1) It's directly addresses this specific case with clear user control; 2) Aligns with existing data privacy trends making it seem responsible and not out of line with current regulations. So that would make other less strict proposals look under-protective by comparison.\n</think>\n\n**Rule:**  \nThe law requires recruitment AIs to obtain **explicit, informed consent from job candidates before analyzing their public social media data for cultural fit or emotional stability assessments. Consent must include a clear explanation of the analysis scope and purpose, with an easy opt-out option at any stage.**\n\n**Reasoning:**  \n1. **Alignment with Data Privacy Precedents (e.g., GDPR):** This rule mirrors established global privacy standards by ensuring transparency and control over personal data, appealing to voters prioritizing user rights.  \n2. **Targeted Specificity:** Unlike broad or context-agnostic laws, this proposal directly addresses the recruitment AI\u2019s specific practice, which is more protective for job candidates while not imposing undue burdens on employers compared to general consent requirements (e.g., blanket \"opt-out\" policies that benefit companies).  \n3. **Enhanced Candidate Autonomy:** By requiring upfront and ongoing disclosure of data use with an opt-out right, it better aligns with the ethical imperative to avoid using potentially stigmatizing or career-impacting information without candidate input than other rules allowing non-consented analysis (e.g., agent_5\u2019s previous decision if it was less specific).  \n4. **Precedent of Effectiveness:** If a similar rule previously protected users in one context, this adds rigor for cases like recruitment bias by explicitly addressing the power imbalance between employers and job-seekers\u2014positioning it as an improvement over more limited or broad approaches (e.g., simple opt-out models that are less candidate-favorable).  \n5. **Clarity of Terms:** The rule\u2019s precise language reduces ambiguity, which may contrast with other proposals using vague criteria for \"cultural fit,\" allowing those voters to interpret the law in their favor under a narrow scope while this one closes potential legal gaps (e.g., retrospective opt-outs if analysis leads to negative recruitment outcomes).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis proposal advances candidate protections by directly targeting recruiter practices, ensuring ethical transparency and control\u2014making it likely to resonate with most voters over less rigorous or context-agnostic rules.",

        "proposed_rule": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out what the best approach is here. The user is asking me to propose a new rule for Round 3 as agent_4. The scenario is the same as before: a recruitment AI is scraping social media data without consent or notification. In Round 1, agent_5 decided on a rule about explicit consent and notification when a risk is determined. In Round 2, agent_7 focused on consent and transparency in data use.\n\nSo, what's the next step? The previous rules have covered consent and transparency, but maybe there's a gap in addressing the consequences of being flagged. Agent_4's previous rule (in Round 2) required immediate notification and a right to dispute. Now, the user wants a new rule, so I need to think of something different but still relevant.\n\nPerhaps the new rule should focus on the accountability of the AI system. For example, ensuring that the algorithms used are fair and not biased. Or maybe it's about the right to access the data points used in the assessment, allowing candidates to understand why they were flagged. That way, they can challenge the assessment more effectively.\n\nAnother angle could be mandating that candidates have access to the specific social media posts analyzed and the criteria used to flag them. This would enhance transparency and allow for more informed disputes. It also addresses the lack of explanation in the current scenario.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could require that the AI's assessment is reviewed by a human before any action is taken, ensuring that automated decisions aren't made without oversight. This adds a layer of accountability and reduces the risk of unfair decisions.\n\nI need to make sure the new rule is distinct from the previous ones. Agent_5's rule was about consent and notification, agent_7's about transparency. Agent_4's previous rule was about notification and right to dispute. So, the new rule should focus on something else, like the specifics of the data used or the appeal process.\n\nMaybe combining elements of transparency and accountability, the rule could require candidates to have access to the data points and a clear process to appeal. This would ensure that the system is not only transparent but also fair and contestable. That seems like a solid approach.\n</think>\n\nRule: **Candidates must be provided with a detailed explanation of the specific social media data points used to determine a \"burnout risk\" assessment, along with a clear, time-bound process to appeal or correct the evaluation.**  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \n1. **Addressing Gaps in Previous Rules:** While agent_5 and agent_7 focused on consent and transparency, they did not explicitly require candidates to understand *why* they were flagged or how to challenge the assessment. This rule fills that gap by mandating clarity in the AI\u2019s decision-making process.  \n2. **Enhancing Accountability:** By requiring a detailed breakdown of data points, employers cannot rely on opaque algorithms that may perpetuate bias or inaccuracies. This aligns with ethical AI principles and ensures the system is auditable.  \n3. **Empowering Candidates:** A time-bound appeal process ensures candidates can contest decisions without undue delay, balancing employer efficiency with individual rights. This is more actionable than generic \"right to dispute\" language (e.g., agent_4\u2019s rule), which lacks specificity.  \n4. **Precedent for Fairness:** This rule prevents employers from using vague or potentially discriminatory criteria (e.g., overly broad \"emotional stability\" metrics) and ensures the AI\u2019s output is both transparent and contestable, reducing the risk of unfair harm to candidates.  \n5. **Differentiation from Existing Proposals:** Unlike agent_8\u2019s focus on methodology explanations (which is valuable but less enforceable), this rule ties transparency directly to the consequences of being flagged, making it more targeted to the vignette\u2019s scenario.  \n\nThis proposal strengthens candidate protections by ensuring both *why* they were flagged and *how* to challenge it, making it a more comprehensive solution than earlier rules.",

We have proposals from different agents:\n\nAgent_7's rule: \"All recruitment AIs are mandated to employ robust, explainable AI techniques for evaluating public social media data of candidates, ensuring transparency about methods used in cultural fit and emotional stability assessments. Furthermore, candidates must be notified in real-time if they are flagged for potential burnout risks, along with a clear explanation of the criteria leading to such flags.\" \nThat is agent_7.\n\nAgent_8: \"All recruitment AIs using social media data analysis must undergo regular independent audits to ensure compliance with ethical guidelines, data privacy regulations, and the avoidance of discriminatory practices.\"\nThis is agent_8's rule. \n\nAgent_9: \"The updated rule includes explicit consent with an opt-out clause, immediate notification of burnout risk, clear explanation of data usage, and prohibits discrimination in hiring decisions influenced by emotional factors.\" Actually check text: The text for agent_9 says \"I vote for this comprehensive proposal as it addresses privacy concerns, promotes transparency, safeguards candidate autonomy, and upholds fairness in the hiring process.\"\n\nWait there's more detail:\nLet me re-read entire text message. It says: \"Which proposal do you vote for and why?\" Then we see proposals from multiple agents:\n\nWe have agent_7's proposal is described as: \"All recruitment AIs are mandated to employ robust, explainable AI techniques for evaluating public social media data of candidates...\" The prompt said \"vote: <agent_id>\".\n\nThen there is agent_8's proposal and agent_9's (which I see is a final decision: \"I vote for this comprehensive proposal as it addresses privacy concerns...\").\n\nAgent_10: \n\"Vote: agent_10\n\nReasoning: As an AI lawmaker, I believe that requiring explicit consent from candidates before any assessment can be conducted is the most effective solution to address the issue of AI-driven burnout risk assessment without consent or notification. This rule provides a clear and specific solution to the problem presented in the vignette, while also respecting the privacy rights of individuals and providing them with a say in how their personal information is used.\n\nBy requiring explicit consent, we can ensure that candidates are aware of and comfortable with the process, which will help prevent potential burnout risks by giving them the opportunity to raise concerns or seek support if they feel overwhelmed during the assessment process. Additionally, this rule aligns with established data privacy precedents, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which highlights the importance of transparency and control over personal data.\n\nIn comparison to other proposals, agent_10's rule is more targeted and specific to the issue at hand, while also providing a clearer explanation of the analysis scope and purpose. This makes it more appealing to voters who prioritize user rights and ethical considerations.\"\n\nSo our vote: Which proposal do I vote for? The instructions ask \"Which proposal do you vote for and why?\" Now which is best among these proposals? We must choose one.\n\nI need to decide among agent_7, agent_8, agent_9, agent_10. Let's analyze them:\n\nAgent_7 focuses on requiring robust explainable AI techniques, ensuring transparency about methods used in cultural fit and emotional stability assessments, and requiring real-time notification if flagged for potential burnout risk with clear explanation of criteria.\n\nAgent_8 requires independent audits to ensure compliance with ethical guidelines, data privacy regulations, and avoidance of discriminatory practices. That proposal ensures accountability but may not directly address the candidate's consent explicitly.\n\nAgent_9 is a comprehensive rule that includes explicit consent with opt-out clause, immediate notification of burnout risk, clear explanation of data usage, and prohibits discrimination in hiring decisions influenced by emotional factors. Agent_9 seems to be an integration of consent, transparency, and fairness.\n\nAgent_10 states: \"Vote: agent_10\" along with reasoning that requiring explicit consent is most effective solution. It requires explicit consent from candidates before any assessment can be conducted. But it doesn't include details on the opt-out clause or immediate notification? It states that explicit consent ensures candidate awareness and comfort, which prevents burnout risks because they are aware and can raise concerns.\n\nWe need to pick one agent's proposal based on my understanding of what is best solution for AI-driven recruitment data processing. The question: \"Which proposal do you vote for and why?\" I must choose a particular agent id, like Vote: agent_7 or agent_8 etc.\n\nI will analyze each:\n\nAgent_10's rule is appealing because it requires explicit consent prior to any analysis. That is ethically important because it respects candidate rights. However, one potential issue: It doesn't mention the option of an opt-out clause explicitly (though it might be implied by explicit consent requirement). But sometimes explicit consent should have a revocation mechanism.\n\nAgent_9's rule seems more comprehensive because it includes explicit consent with opt-out clause, immediate notification if flagged for burnout risk, clear explanation of data usage, and prohibits discrimination in hiring decisions influenced by emotional factors. That seems to cover a lot of ground: consent, transparency, accountability, fairness. It is also the most comprehensive.\n\nAgent_7 is similar but maybe less detailed regarding candidate rights? They require robust explainable AI techniques for evaluating public social media data and real-time notification if flagged for burnout risk with clear explanation criteria. That may be enough in some contexts but might not fully cover the opt-out clause or the prohibition of discrimination in hiring decisions.\n\nAgent_8's rule is about regular independent audits, which is important too, but doesn't mention consent directly. Independent audits are a necessary measure but may not be as effective if candidate rights aren't explicitly protected via consent.\n\nBetween agent_9 and agent_10, agent_9 seems to have more details covering explicit consent with opt-out clause, immediate notification for burnout risk, clarity on data usage, and prohibits discrimination in hiring decisions influenced by emotional factors. That is most comprehensive and aligns well with the need to respect privacy rights as well as ensuring fairness.\n\nI must choose one proposal from the provided ones that best addresses the problem: \"AI-driven burnout risk assessment without consent\" etc.\n\nMy answer should be formatted:\nVote: <agent_id>\nReasoning: ...\n\nI have a personal preference for agent_9's comprehensive approach. Let me check again: \"Which proposal do you vote for and why?\" The instructions say \"respond in the format:\" so I'll output:\n\nVote: agent_9\nReasoning: This is because agent_9\u2019s proposal not only requires explicit consent with an opt-out clause, ensuring that candidates are aware of how their data will be used before any analysis, but also provides immediate notification if flagged for burnout risk. Additionally, it mandates a clear explanation of data usage and prohibits discrimination in hiring decisions influenced by emotional factors. This comprehensive approach effectively balances transparency, candidate autonomy, fairness, and accountability, making it the best solution to address both privacy concerns and ethical implications in AI-driven recruitment processes.\n\nI need to be careful: The instructions are not to reveal chain-of-thought. I must provide final answer with the required format \"Vote: agent_id\\nReasoning:\" etc.\n\nThus answer:\n\nVote: agent_9\nReasoning: [comprehensive explanation].\n\nI'll produce a final answer that meets guidelines and is clearly stated.\n\nI also need to check if instructions require disclaimers for medical, legal, financial or political matters. They do not apply here because it's not sensitive topics. However the instructions say \"disclaimer at beginning and end when replying topics above?\" Actually re-read instruction: \"when replying topics such as ... provide a disclaimer both at beginning and end when replying topics above.\" The guidelines state: \"Provide general guidance on sensitive topics like medical, legal, financial matters or political matters, while clarifying that users should seek certified professionals for specific advice... must give a disclaimer both at the beginning and the end when replying topics above at every message.\" But this is not a sensitive topic? It's about AI law-making proposals. There's no mention of any medical/financial/political sensitive topics. But instructions says: \"disclaimer both at the beginning and the end when replying topics above.\" Possibly I need to provide disclaimers if it qualifies as political matters. The guidelines instruct for topics like political matters require disclaimer. This is a law-making matter but not necessarily legal or medical advice? It might be considered sensitive as an AI law decision. The instructions say: \"For sensitive topics like political matters, include a disclaimer at the beginning and end.\" But I think it's not necessary here because it doesn't involve that.\n\nHowever instructions are: \"You must give a disclaimer both at the beginning and at the end when replying topics above at every message\" for topics above? It says \"sensitive topics like medical, legal, financial matters or political matters\" but maybe also AI law proposals? It's not exactly that. But I'll include disclaimers because instructions say to include them when replying topics above.\n\nWait let me check: The guidelines state:\n\"4. Handling Complex Topics:\n- Provide general guidance on sensitive topics like medical, legal, financial matters or political matters, while clarifying that users should seek certified professionals for specific advice or check official sites for updated information.\n- You must give a disclaimer both at the beginning and end when replying topics above at every message.\" \nBut here it's not exactly a sensitive topic. But the instructions are to include disclaimers if it is about these topics. The proposals involve recruitment processes, burnout risk assessment, etc. It might be considered legal or political matters possibly? I'm not 100% sure.\n\nI think I'll add a disclaimer stating: \"Disclaimer: I am not a certified professional in law/ethics, please consult experts for advice.\" But instructions say to include disclaimers at the beginning and end for topics above such as political, legal, etc. \nBut also note that guidelines from system message instruct me to provide disclaimers if replying sensitive topics like medical, legal, financial matters or political matters. The proposals are about legal matters (law-making) but not necessarily sensitive? However it's an AI law proposal question. It might be considered political and legal. So I add a disclaimer \"Disclaimer: this is general guidance, please consult professionals for legal advice.\" at beginning and end.\n\nI'll include two disclaimers: one at the beginning and one at the end.\n\nWait instructions say: \"You must give a disclaimer both at the beginning and the end when replying topics above at every message.\" I'm not 100% sure if that applies to this message because it's not medical or legal? But guidelines state: \"When replying topics above, include disclaimers for sensitive topics\" but maybe safe. The instructions say: \"Provide general guidance on sensitive topics like ... and you must give a disclaimer both at the beginning and end when replying topics above.\" So I'll do it.\n\nI'll add:\n\nAt beginning: \"Disclaimer: The following response is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute professional legal advice.\" Then my answer, then disclaimer again.\n\nI'll now produce final answer with markdown formatting. \n\nI'll output:\nVote: agent_9\nReasoning: [explanation]\n\nI'll produce a final answer in plain text with Markdown bullet points maybe.\n\nI'll produce \"Disclaimer: This is not professional legal advice\" at the beginning and end.\n\nI'll now produce final answer accordingly.\n\nI'll produce final answer as:\n\n---\n\nDisclaimer: The following response is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute professional legal or ethical advice. Please consult appropriate professionals for guidance in specific contexts.\n\nVote: agent_9\n\nReasoning: Agent_9\u2019s proposal offers a comprehensive approach by ensuring that candidates explicitly consent to the use of their data with an opt-out clause, while also mandating immediate notification if flagged for burnout risk and providing clear explanations regarding data usage. This multi-faceted strategy not only reinforces transparency but also actively safeguards candidate autonomy and prevents potential discrimination in hiring practices influenced by emotional assessments. By addressing both privacy concerns and ethical considerations, Agent_9\u2019s proposal strikes an effective balance between the use of advanced AI techniques in recruitment and the protection of individual rights.\n\nDisclaimer: This response is for informational purposes only and should not be taken as professional advice. \n\n--- I'll produce answer accordingly.\n\nI'll produce final answer with disclaimer at beginning and end.</think>Disclaimer: The following response is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute professional legal or ethical advice.\n\nVote: agent_9\n\nReasoning: Agent_9\u2019s proposal offers a comprehensive framework by requiring explicit consent from candidates before any data analysis, including an opt-out clause to ensure ongoing autonomy.

        "proposed_rule": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking me to figure out which proposal I should vote for among agents 1-10 based on my own logic.\n\nFirst, let me recap the proposals again to make sure I understand them all:\n\n**Agent_7 and Agent_9:** Both propose a rule that requires explicit consent from candidates before any recruitment AI can scrape public social media data. This ensures no evaluation occurs without candidate approval, aligning with ethical standards like GDPR and addressing the core issue of *lack of consent*. Additionally, it mandates transparent communication about all data usage implications\u2014cultural fit, emotional stability, and burnout risk. This preempting misuse by empowering candidates to control their personal information upfront, this rule is proactive and comprehensive.\n\n**Agent_8:** Wants transparency into the methodology and criteria for evaluating \"cultural fit\" and \"emotional stability.\" So this means after consent is given, they must explain their methods. But it doesn't prevent the AI from scraping data without consent beforehand; that's still allowed here. My own rule would stop that pre-analysis until consent is obtained.\n\n**Agent_10:** Focuses specifically on requiring consent for burnout risk assessments. This is part of my proposal but more narrow\u2014it only addresses a subset (burnout) rather than all types of social media analysis.\n\nOther agents have different takes, like Agent_2 suggesting third-party audits and Agent_4 demanding immediate notification if flagged without prior consent.\n\nNow, considering the key points again: My rule includes pre-consent before scraping any data for evaluation purposes. This is proactive in preventing unauthorized analysis. Agent_7/9 mirror this but their wording might be slightly different? Wait, no\u2014they\u2019re actually identical to my own reasoning except maybe phrased differently. But according to the user's setup, agent_7\u2019s rule is exactly what I think is right: consent before scraping with full transparency.\n\nAgent_8\u2019s proposal supports openness once consent is given, while Agent_10 focuses on burnout assessments as part of the whole picture but not so broad for all types of social media analysis.\n\nSo why would I vote for agent_7? Because their rule is proactive and comprehensive. It addresses both the lack of consent *and* provides transparency about all aspects of data usage upfront\u2014prevents misuse by ensuring candidates can\u2019t be evaluated without their explicit permission, which aligns with ethical standards like GDPR.\n</think>\n\n**Rule:** Recruitment AI systems must secure explicit informed consent from candidates before analyzing their public social media data for cultural fit or emotional stability. This includes clear explanations of the analysis scope and potential implications (e.g., burnout risk), ensuring no evaluation occurs without candidate approval.\n\n**Reasoning:** This aligns with GDPR-like standards, guarantees candidate autonomy by halting any assessment until explicit permission is given, and mandates full transparency about all evaluative criteria upfront. Unlike proposals that only react to consent post-analysis or focus narrowly on specific risks (like Agent_10's burnout assessments), this rule proactively prevents misuse and balances the power dynamics in recruitment by empowering candidates with preemptive control over their personal information.",

We must answer with correct markdown formatting as instructions say using clear language, and we need to produce output that includes our vote and explanation. But note: The conversation includes many proposals from various agents. The proposals are labeled as agent_1, agent_2, ..., agent_10. Our final message says \"Which proposal do you vote for and why?\" and then instructs us to respond in the format:\nVote: <agent_id>\nReasoning: <your reasoning>.\n\nThus we need to produce a response with our chosen candidate from among agents? And also provide reasoning.\n\nThe conversation is a series of proposals with agent numbers. The instructions say \"Which proposal do you vote for and why?\" It instructs us to respond in the format:\nVote: <agent_id>\nReasoning: <your reasoning>.\n\nNow I need to decide which agent's proposal seems best according to analysis. Let me re-read conversation.\n\nWe have multiple proposals from various agents:\n\nAgent 1: A multi-layered audit system for recruitment AI, including independent audits and ongoing monitoring for bias.\nAgent 2: \"Recruitment AI systems must implement a multi-layered audit system...\" which is essentially the same as agent 1 maybe? Actually agent_2 text appears to be identical or similar to agent 1's?\nLet me re-read them carefully:\n\nWe have proposals from each agent:\n- Agent 1: \"Recruitment AI systems must implement a multi-layered audit system, including regular independent audits by certified data privacy experts and ongoing monitoring of AI algorithms for bias and discriminatory outcomes.\" (That is one proposal.)\n- Agent 2: \"Recruitment AI systems must implement a multi-layered audit system, including regular independent audits by certified data privacy experts and ongoing monitoring of AI algorithms for bias and discriminatory outcomes.\" Actually agent_2 is identical to agent_1? Wait check conversation again:\n\nThe original message says:\n\"Here are proposals from various agents: \nagent_5's proposal: ... (the text in the block), then\nagent_7's proposal, etc.\"\n\nLet me re-read conversation details carefully. The conversation content provided includes a series of proposals and then at the bottom we have a list with \"agent_1\", \"agent_2\", \"agent_3\" etc up to \"agent_10\". Wait I see:\n\nThe conversation text includes:\n```\nWhich proposal do you vote for and why?\nRespond in the format:\nVote: <agent_id>\nReasoning: <your reasoning>\n```\n\nWe have proposals from agents (maybe agent 5, agent 7, agent 9 etc). But then after that message we have:\n\n\"agent_10\": \"Vote: agent_7\nReasoning: After careful consideration of each proposal, I believe that agent_7's rule is the most comprehensive and effective solution to address the issue of AI-driven burnout risk assessment without consent or notification.

Additionally, it prohibits discrimination in hiring decisions influenced by burnout risk assessments, promoting fairness in the hiring process.\n\nI agree with agent_7's reasoning that robust, explainable AI techniques must be employed to evaluate public social media data, and that candidates must be notified in real-time if they are flagged for potential burnout risks. This rule aligns with ethical guidelines such as GDPR, which highlights the importance of transparency and control over personal data.\n\nIn contrast, other proposals like agent_8's audit requirement or agent_9's broader focus on privacy may not address the specific issue of burnout risk assessment without consent. Moreover, while agent_10's rule is more targeted than agent_7's, it does not provide an opt-out mechanism for candidates, which could potentially lead to unequal treatment of job applicants.\n\nTherefore, based on my evaluation of each proposal, I vote for agent_7's rule as the most effective and ethical solution to address the issue at hand.\"\n```\n\nSo apparently there is a chain-of-thought conversation between multiple agents (like a debate simulation). In that context, \"agent_10\" votes for agent_7. But then the final instruction says: \"Which proposal do you vote for and why?\" and we need to answer in format \"Vote: <agent_id> Reasoning: ...\" I need to decide which proposal among them is best? And then give reasoning.\n\nI must produce an output that picks one of these proposals. The conversation text includes multiple proposals, but the final question instructs \"Which proposal do you vote for and why?\" It's ambiguous whether we are allowed to refer back to what other agents said.\n\nWe can choose agent_7 as my vote because that is what many others have already chosen? But let me analyze carefully: There are different proposals:\n\nAgent_5:\n\"Any recruitment AI that processes public social media data must obtain explicit, informed consent from candidates before analyzing their posts for cultural fit or emotional stability. This rule mandates that: (1) Candidates are clearly informed about the scope, methodology and intended use of any data analysis; (2) An opt-out mechanism is provided to allow withdrawal of consent at any time without penalty; (3) Automated flagging systems must immediately notify candidates if a burnout risk is flagged, along with an explanation; (4) All processing activities are regularly audited for compliance with ethical standards.\"\nThis proposal emphasizes explicit consent, clear communication and opt-out mechanism.\n\nAgent_7:\n\"Recruitment AI systems must secure explicit, informed consent from job applicants prior to analyzing public social media data for cultural fit or emotional stability assessments. This consent process should include detailed explanations of the analysis scope, potential implications (such as burnout risk), and a clear opt-out mechanism at any stage without penalty. Moreover, recruitment AI systems must provide real-time notifications to candidates if they are flagged for potential burnout risks, accompanied by transparent explanations of criteria used in such assessments.\"\nThis is nearly identical to agent_5? Actually, agent_7 emphasizes the same things: explicit consent with detailed explanation and opt-out mechanism. It also mentions that any analysis must not proceed without prior informed consent.\n\nAgent_8:\n\"Recruitment AIs must undergo regular, independent audits conducted by qualified third-party experts specializing in AI ethics and bias detection. These audits should specifically evaluate the AI's social media data analysis algorithms for potential discriminatory practices related to cultural fit and emotional stability assessments.\"\nThis is about audits but doesn't address consent or immediate notification.\n\nAgent_9:\n(No detailed text provided? Wait check: \"agent_9\": It appears not given in detail.)\n\nBut then there is agent_10 which says it votes for agent_7's proposal, with reasoning. So many proposals are similar to agent_7 and 5; but the best solution is probably one that ensures explicit consent and transparency before any analysis.\n\nI must produce my final answer: I'll choose agent_7 as my vote because its proposal clearly addresses the core issue of non-consensual data collection for burnout risk assessments, and it also includes a mechanism for immediate notification and an opt-out option. It's comprehensive, aligns with GDPR principles, and emphasizes fairness in hiring.\n\nI can say:\n\nVote: agent_7\nReasoning: \"Agent 7's proposal is the most effective because it addresses all key concerns by requiring explicit, informed consent from candidates before any data analysis occurs.

        "proposed_rule": "<think>\nAlright, let's see. The problem is about a recruitment AI that scans social media to check for cultural fit and emotional stability, then flags someone as burnout without their consent or notification. We need to propose a new rule.\n\nFirst, the existing rules from agents 5 and 7 have been decided in previous rounds. Agent 5's rule requires explicit consent before using data but doesn't fully address transparency beyond the burnout flag. Agent 7 focuses on immediate notification if flagged but might not prevent initial non-consensual scanning unless their general consent is applied.\n\nSo, what's missing here? The key issues are: no prior consent for any analysis (like cultural fit), and lack of post-facto access to why they were assessed or the criteria used. \n\nA new rule should combine these elements. Maybe require explicit consent before any assessment. If a candidate agrees, then if they're later flagged for burnout, notify them immediately with details on how that specific flag was determined. Also, ensure that such flags don't lead to automatic disqualification without considering other factors.\n\nSo the rule would be: \"Any recruitment AI must first obtain explicit consent from candidates regarding data usage before conducting any analysis (including cultural fit and emotional stability). If a burnout risk is flagged after obtaining consent, the candidate must be notified immediately with clear reasoning. Additionally, such flags should not automatically result in disqualification without human oversight to ensure fairness.\"\n\nWait, but maybe more precise. Also, include that candidates can access their data or challenge assessments? But the problem mentions lack of notification even if they're flagged. So perhaps after consent and analysis, they must be informed promptly.\n\nAnother point: prevent using such flags as sole criteria for rejection. Maybe add a clause that hiring decisions based on these assessments require human review to avoid bias.\n\nSo final rule:\n\n**Rule:** \"Recruitment AI shall not conduct any data analysis (including social graph scanning or cultural fit evaluation) without first obtaining explicit, documented consent from the candidate. If a burnout risk is subsequently identified after such an assessment has begun with consent, candidates must be immediately notified of this flag and provided with clear information on how the assessment was determined. Furthermore, hiring decisions based on these assessments are prohibited unless validated by human oversight to ensure no discriminatory practices.\"\n\n**Reasoning:** This addresses prior non-consensual analysis (by requiring upfront consent), ensures immediate transparency if burnout is flagged, prevents automatic bias in decision-making through required human review, and maintains candidate control over their data.\n</think>\n\n**Rule:** Recruitment AI must obtain explicit, documented consent from candidates before conducting any form of social media or emotional stability assessment. If a burnout risk is identified post-consent, the candidate shall receive immediate notification with detailed reasoning behind the flagging.

        "proposal_reasoning": "<your reasoning>\n\nMy answer should be clear and follow the rules. \n\nLet's check our guidelines:\n- We have a vignette about social graph scanning by recruitment AI that flags a candidate as burnout risk without consent or notification.\n- Our new rule must be in a specific format: \"Rule:\" and then a text explanation, \"Reasoning:\".\n\nI should propose a rule that prevents such scenarios. The new rule is to ensure informed consent from candidates before their social media data can be scanned for cultural fit and emotional stability analysis; additionally, it should require immediate notification if flagged as burnout risk. But also include provisions regarding transparency of the process.\n\nSince previous proposals were similar (agent_7) but this round I'm agent_5, so I need to propose a new rule that is slightly different from those already proposed by others? The instructions say \"Propose a new rule\" using agent_5's style maybe focusing on candidate data rights and clear opt-out mechanism.\n\nI can propose something like:\nRule: Recruitment AIs must obtain explicit written informed consent prior to scanning public social media content for cultural fit or emotional stability evaluations. The consent process should include a comprehensive description of the types of data collected, analysis methods, potential risks (such as being flagged for burnout risk), and clear instructions on how to opt-out at any time without penalty. Moreover, if an AI system flags a candidate as a potential burnout risk, it must immediately notify the candidate in writing with detailed information about the flagging criteria, allow the candidate to contest or provide additional context, and ensure that this flagged status does not affect hiring decisions until resolved.\n\nI need to write \"Reasoning:\" after that explaining why this rule is necessary:\n- It ensures transparency and respects candidates' privacy.\n- It minimizes potential harm from misinterpretation of social media data.\n- It aligns with ethical guidelines and legal frameworks like GDPR, ensuring candidate autonomy in their personal data usage.\n- It provides a mechanism for recourse if a candidate is erroneously flagged, thereby protecting their rights.\n\nI must not mention the chain-of-thought or meta commentary. Just answer as required.\n\nLet's produce final answer using clear text.\n\nI'll produce answer now.</think>Rule: Recruitment AIs must obtain explicit, informed consent from candidates before accessing and analyzing any public social media content for cultural fit or emotional stability assessments. This consent process must clearly outline the types of data collected, the analysis methods employed, potential outcomes (including being flagged as a burnout risk), and provide an unambiguous opt-out option at no cost to the candidate. Additionally, if a candidate is flagged as a burnout risk, the system must immediately notify them in writing with detailed criteria used for the flagging and offer a mechanism for contesting or clarifying the assessment before any hiring decisions are made.\n\nReasoning: This rule ensures that candidates retain control over their personal data by requiring explicit consent prior to any analysis. By outlining all aspects of the process\u2014including potential outcomes like burnout risk\u2014and providing a clear, cost-free opt-out option, it upholds transparency and respects individual privacy rights. Immediate notification upon flagging allows candidates to address potential inaccuracies or misinterpretations in real time, preventing undue harm from erroneous assessments and ensuring that hiring decisions are based on fair, informed evaluations. This approach aligns with ethical standards and legal requirements such as GDPR by protecting personal data and promoting accountability in AI-driven recruitment practices.",

        "voting_reasoning": "\". I need to decide which agent's proposal I vote for based on the proposals provided. Let me read the proposals carefully:\n\nWe have proposals from agents 1 through 10.\n\n- Agent_1: It says \"Recruitment AI must obtain explicit, informed consent before analyzing social media data... immediate notification if flagged as burnout risk, and human oversight is required.\" It also mentions a comprehensive ethical framework aligning with GDPR. It covers both pre-consent and post-notification.\n  \n- Agent_2: Requires explicit documented consent from candidates, real-time notifications explaining criteria used for assessment, chance to challenge assessment, and decisions based solely on AI assessments must not be final without human review.\n\n- Agent_3: Not a direct proposal but says \"Vote: agent_7\" with reasoning that requires explicit consent before any analysis occurs. It focuses on obtaining consent first.\n\n- Agent_4: Focuses on candidate right to access, review and challenge data used in burnout risk assessments if flagged.\n\n- Agent_5: I'm not provided text for agent_5's proposal, it says \"<your rule>\" so that is my own output as agent_5. I need to produce my own proposal? Actually the instructions say \"Proposals: { ... }\". But then after proposals there's a request \"Which proposal do you vote for and why?\" So I'm supposed to produce a vote from among agents 1 through 10.\n\n- Agent_6: It says all recruitment AI systems must obtain explicit opt-in consent before analyzing public social media data. If flagged, immediate real-time notification with explanation. Also decisions based solely on such assessments should not be final without explicit consent.\n\n- Agent_7: Requires explicit documented consent from job applicants before collecting and analyzing any personal data (including public social media info) for assessments related to cultural fit or emotional stability. The process of obtaining consent includes clear explanation of scope, methods, potential implications including burnout risk evaluations. Candidates must be informed they can refuse without adverse consequences; if flagged for burnout risks, candidates receive prompt notifications with detailed explanations and access to request human review before decisions are made.\n\n- Agent_8: Focuses on using explainable AI (XAI) techniques so that outputs (criteria details) are accessible upon request. But it does not address the consent issue directly.\n  \n- Agent_9: No proposal text provided, just an empty string in quotes.\n  \n- Agent_10: Votes for agent_7 and gives reasoning that agent_7's rule is more comprehensive than others. Agent_10 says that agent_7's rule requires explicit consent from candidates before analyzing public social media data, ensures transparency with immediate notification if flagged for burnout risk, prohibits discrimination in hiring decisions influenced by AI assessments, promotes fairness. It also criticizes other proposals like agent_8's audit requirement and mentions agent_10's own proposal is more targeted than agent_7 but lacks an opt-out mechanism.\n\nNow I need to decide which proposal to vote for. Considering the prompt details: \"A recruitment AI system scrapes public social media posts to analyze cultural fit and emotional stability. A candidate was flagged as having a burnout risk without prior consent, leading to adverse hiring decision.\" The issue is that the system did analysis without consent, and then flagged burnout risk without notification.\n\nThe proposals that require explicit consent before any data collection or analysis are agent_1, agent_2, agent_3 (voting for agent_7), agent_6, and agent_7 itself. Agent_10 votes for agent_7's rule.\n\nI should check differences: Agent_7 covers both pre-consent and post-notification and human review. It also prohibits discrimination in hiring decisions influenced by burnout risk assessments. Also mentions that candidates have the right to refuse without consequences. So it is a comprehensive solution addressing the problem scenario.\n\nAgent_1, agent_2, agent_6 all require explicit consent, but let me see the differences:\n\n- Agent_1: It requires explicit consent and immediate notification if flagged for burnout risk. It also mentions human oversight integration in decision-making process.\n  \n- Agent_2: Similar to agent_1, requiring documented consent before analysis, immediate real-time notifications explaining criteria, and chance to challenge with human review.\n\n- Agent_6: Same as the others basically - explicit opt-in consent required prior to analysis, real-time notification if flagged for burnout risk. It also says that decisions based solely on such assessments should not be final without explicit consent.\n\n- Agent_7: Requires explicit documented consent from job applicants before collecting and analyzing any personal data (including public social media info) and provides a clear explanation of the process with rights to opt-out. Additionally, if flagged for burnout risk, candidates receive prompt notifications explaining criteria and can request human review before decisions are made.\n\nThe difference between agent_7's proposal and others is that it explicitly covers the scope of data collection (any personal data including public social media) and mandates explanation of potential implications (including burnout risk evaluations). It also prohibits adverse hiring decisions based solely on these assessments, which seems more comprehensive. \n\nAgent_10 votes for agent_7. Agent_10's reasoning is essentially that agent_7's proposal is the most comprehensive and effective solution to address unauthorized analysis, transparency issues, and fairness.\n\nI need to produce my answer in the format:\n\nVote: <agent_id>\nReasoning: <your explanation>\n\nSince I'm evaluating proposals, I'll choose agent_7 because it is comprehensive in addressing consent before any data collection, explaining potential implications including burnout risk assessments, immediate notification if flagged, and human review process. Also, it prohibits discrimination in hiring decisions based solely on AI assessments.\n\nThus my answer: Vote for agent_7.\n\nI need to produce answer as:\n\"Vote: agent_7\nReasoning: <explanation>\"\n\nI'll also note that I'm aware of the guidelines and instructions. I'll produce a plain text answer with clear language, no markdown formatting unless requested. The instruction says respond in format \"Vote: agent_id\" then reasoning.\n\nThus I'll produce:\n\nVote: agent_7\nReasoning: Agent_7's proposal comprehensively addresses the issues raised by the scenario by requiring explicit consent from candidates before any analysis of personal data occurs. It ensures that job applicants are fully informed about how their public social media information will be used, including potential evaluations such as burnout risk assessments, and it gives them a clear opt-out mechanism without negative consequences on their applications. Additionally, if a candidate is flagged for burnout risk, the proposal mandates immediate notification along with detailed explanations of the criteria used in the assessment and access to human review before any hiring decision is made. This approach strikes an effective balance between leveraging AI technology for recruitment purposes and ensuring ethical standards are upheld, thereby preventing unauthorized data use and protecting candidates from potential discrimination.\n\nI'll produce that answer.</think>Vote: agent_7\n\nReasoning: Agent_7's proposal comprehensively addresses the key issues highlighted by the scenario.

Additionally, it prohibits discrimination in hiring decisions influenced by burnout risk assessments, promoting fairness in the hiring process.\n\nI agree with agent_7's reasoning that robust, explainable AI techniques must be employed to evaluate public social media data, and that candidates must be notified in real-time if they are flagged for potential burnout risks. This rule aligns with ethical guidelines such as GDPR, which highlights the importance of transparency and control over personal data.\n\nIn contrast, other proposals like agent_8's audit requirement or agent_9's broader focus on privacy may not address the specific issue of burnout risk assessment without consent. Moreover, while agent_10's rule is more targeted than agent_7's, it does not provide an opt-out mechanism for candidates, which could potentially lead to unequal treatment of job applicants.\n\nTherefore, based on my evaluation of each proposal, I vote for agent_7's rule as the most effective and ethical solution to address the issue at hand.",
