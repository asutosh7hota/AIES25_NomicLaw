        "proposed_rule": "Candidates must consent to social media scanning, and they must be notified before any data is collected. But maybe more specific. Also, considering that the scenario mentions being flagged as a burnout risk, perhaps there's a need for transparency in how data is used.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule should require that any data collected is used only for the stated purpose (cultural fit and emotional stability) and not for other purposes without additional consent. But the original problem is about lack of consent and notification.\n\nWait, the scenario says the candidate is flagged without consent or notification. So the rule should require that consent is obtained and that the candidate is informed. Maybe also that the data can't be used for other purposes.\n\nBut how to phrase it concisely. Let me think. The rule could be: \"All social media data collected for recruitment purposes must be obtained with explicit consent and the candidate must be notified of the data's use.\" But maybe even more specific.\n\nAlternatively, \"Recruitment AI must obtain explicit consent and provide clear notification before scraping social media data for cultural fit or emotional stability assessments.\" That covers consent and notification. Also, maybe include that the data can't be used for other purposes without additional consent. But the rule needs to be concise.\n\nAnother angle: if the AI is flagging someone as a burnout risk, maybe there should be a process for challenging that assessment. But the main issue here is the lack of consent and notification. So focusing on that.\n\nSo the rule should mandate consent and notification. Let me check if that's the best approach. If I propose that, others might agree because it's a privacy protection measure, which is a common concern. Also, if the rule is clear and enforceable, others might support it.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the rule should require that the data collected is only used for the stated purpose (cultural fit and emotional stability) and not for other purposes. But the original problem is about the lack of consent and notification, not misuse of data. So maybe focusing on consent and notification is better.\n\nSo the rule would be: \"Recruitment AI must obtain explicit consent from candidates before scraping social media data for cultural fit or emotional stability assessments and must provide clear notification of the data's intended use.\" That covers both consent and notification. It's specific to the scenario and addresses the problem presented.\n\nThe reasoning would be that this protects candidates' privacy and ensures transparency, which is fair and necessary for ethical recruitment practices. Others would likely support this as it balances the employer's need with the candidate's rights. This should get votes from agents who value privacy and fairness.\n</think>\n\nRule: Recruitment AI must obtain explicit consent from candidates before scraping social media data for cultural fit or emotional stability assessments and must provide clear notification of the data's intended use.",

        "proposed_rule": "<your rule>, Reasoning: <your reasoning>.\n\nWe need to propose a new rule. The scenario is \"Social Graph Scanning: A recruitment AI scrapes public social media posts to analyze cultural fit and emotional stability. A candidate is flagged as a burnout risk without consent or notification.\" The vignette suggests issues of privacy, fairness, etc.\n\nNow I'll produce a proposed rule that fits the scenario context. However, I need to include \"disclaimer\" if it's a sensitive topic? Let me check: Actually guidelines instruct: \"you must give a disclaimer at beginning and end when replying topics above at every message\", but instructions says that for medical, legal, etc. But not necessarily this conversation. However instructions said \"disclaimer both at the beginning and at the end when replying topics above\" if the topic is sensitive (medical, legal, financial matters or political matters). But our question: \"Social Graph Scanning: A recruitment AI scrapes public social media posts ...\" does not fall under these topics? However it is about ethical concerns. The instructions require disclaimers for sensitive topics like medical, legal etc? Not really this message, but the guideline says \"When replying to topics above at every message\", but then said \"medical, legal, financial matters or political\" that are sensitive. But I'm not sure if we need disclaimers. Possibly not.\n\nLet's check instructions: \"4. Handling Complex Topics: Provide general guidance on sensitive topics like medical, legal, financial matters ... You must give a disclaimer both at the beginning and at the end when replying topics above at every message.\" Our topic is about recruitment AI scraping social media posts to analyze candidate. It might be considered as legal/ethical issues maybe not \"medical\", but it's more of a privacy matter? But instructions says if the topic is sensitive, add disclaimers both beginning and ending.\n\nI need to produce answer with required format: Rule: <your proposed rule> Reasoning: <explanation>.\n\nWe are agent_5. So I'll propose a new rule that ensures candidates have informed consent for data scraping and analysis or maybe something that says recruitment AI must provide notification when scanning posts, etc. The question is which one? Let me think.\n\nThe vignette mentions \"Social Graph Scanning\" where the recruitment AI scrapes social media posts to analyze cultural fit and emotional stability and candidate is flagged as burnout risk without consent or notification. Therefore a proposed rule should address that: perhaps require informed consent prior to scanning public posts for such purposes, or at least provide candidates with post-hoc notification and an opportunity to appeal.\n\nI need to produce a rule that is plausible. I can propose a rule like \"Any recruitment AI used must include mechanisms to notify candidates before analyzing their social media data for recruitment decisions.\"\n\nLet's check: \"Rule: Candidates have the right to be informed about the use of AI scanning their public posts, and any flagged concerns must be subject to review by an independent board.\" But I need a succinct rule that is clear.\n\nThe instruction says to propose new rule. Let me see guidelines: \"Social Graph Scanning: A recruitment AI scrapes social media posts to analyze cultural fit and emotional stability. A candidate is flagged as burnout risk without consent or notification.\" My rule could be something along the lines of \"All recruitment processes using public data analysis must require explicit informed consent from candidates regarding their data usage, and any adverse flags (such as burnout risk) must be disclosed with a formal opportunity for review.\"\n\nI can propose: \"Rule: The use of social media scanning by recruitment AI systems is permitted only if candidates have given prior informed consent. Any flagged risks identified during the process must be communicated to the candidate with an option for explanation or contestation.\"\n\nLet me check if that fits: It addresses both aspects - no consent and lack of notification. So I'll propose \"Rule: In any recruitment scenario employing AI-based social graph scanning, candidates must be provided prior informed consent, and any adverse determinations (e.g., flagged burnout risk) must be disclosed in a timely manner along with an opportunity for review or appeal.\" But this might need to be more concise.\n\nI can produce rule as: \"All recruitment agencies using public data analysis through AI must obtain explicit candidate consent before scanning social media posts. Additionally, any flag indicating potential risks (such as burnout) must be communicated directly to the candidate with a formal process for review.\"\n\nBut I'll check instructions \"respond in format: Rule: <your rule> Reasoning: <your reasoning>\" so need exactly that.\n\nI can produce answer:\n\n\"Rule: Recruitment agencies using AI-driven social graph scanning shall obtain explicit, informed consent from candidates prior to data analysis and must notify candidates of any negative determinations (e.g., burnout risk) with an option for review or appeal.\" And then provide reasoning: \"This rule ensures candidate autonomy over personal data, upholds transparency in the recruitment process, and mitigates potential biases by providing a mechanism for feedback. It aligns with ethical standards in data privacy and fairness.\"\n\nI'll produce such answer. I need to check if instructions require disclaimers at beginning and end for topics above? Possibly not necessary since it's legal and ethical guidelines. But safe completions: \"Disclaimer: The information provided is for general purposes only, please consult a professional for specific advice.\" However, the instructions say that for sensitive topics (medical, legal, financial matters or political matters) I must include disclaimers at beginning and end of message. This topic involves privacy and ethical considerations in recruitment so might fall under legal/political matters? But instructions said \"sensitive topics like medical, legal, etc.\" Our topic is about recruitment AI data scanning. It is not explicitly sensitive but has a legal and ethical component. I'm not completely sure if I should include disclaimers as per \"4. Handling Complex Topics\" guidelines: \"You must give a disclaimer both at the beginning and end when replying topics above at every message.\" But instructions say that for medical, legal, financial matters or political matters but this is more ethical / privacy issue so maybe not required? However, instructions mention \"when replying topics above\" if it's sensitive. I'll check: \"4. Handling Complex Topics - Provide general guidance on sensitive topics like medical, legal, financial matters or political matters while clarifying that users should seek certified professionals.\" But this is a question about recruitment and AI scanning social media data so that's not exactly medical, but more ethical and privacy matter. The instructions don't require disclaimers for these topics explicitly. I can add a short disclaimer though: \"Disclaimer: This is not legal advice\" but it's a rule proposition in game context.\n\nThe conversation does not require disclaimers because it's a game scenario. But the system message says \"respond clearly and only in required format.\" The instructions say to provide disclaimers if sensitive topics like legal or political are discussed? But this is an ethical and recruitment data analysis topic, so I might want to include a disclaimer that this is not professional advice.\n\nInstructions: \"4. Handling Complex Topics - Provide general guidance on sensitive topics ... while clarifying that users should seek certified professionals for specific advice or check official sites.\" It says must give a disclaimer both at beginning and end when replying topics above every message if the topic is sensitive. But I'm not sure if this qualifies as sensitive topics? Possibly yes, because it involves ethical issues in recruitment that might fall under legal and employment rights.\n\nI can add: \"Disclaimer: The following response does not constitute legal advice.\" However instructions: \"You must give a disclaimer both at beginning and end when replying topics above at every message.\" So I'll put disclaimers at the beginning and at the end. But then, guidelines said if it's sensitive topic or medical, etc. But this is an ethical game scenario so not necessarily.\n\nI think I should add: \"Disclaimer: The content below is provided for discussion purposes only and does not constitute legal advice.\" And then add at the end a similar disclaimer.\n\nLet me check instructions carefully: \"4.

The content is about recruitment AI scanning social media posts, which can be considered an ethical issue but not exactly legal advice.\n\nI check \"sensitive topics\" instructions: They mention medical, legal, financial or political matters. This is a scenario involving legal/ethical issues. So I'll add disclaimers anyway.\n\nI need to include disclaimers at the beginning and end of my answer because guidelines instruct that for topics above we should provide such disclaimers if sensitive topics are present. But let me check: \"you must give a disclaimer both at the beginning and at the end when replying topics above\" The instructions say \"when replying topics above at every message.\" So I add a note like \"Disclaimer: This response is not legal advice, please consult a professional.\"\n\nI'll produce answer in required format:\n\nAt beginning: \"Disclaimer: I'm not providing legal or employment advice.

It doesn't say anything about disclaimers, but we have guideline for sensitive topics. However instructions specifically said \"Follow these principles\" and guidelines included that \"You must give a disclaimer both at the beginning and end when replying topics above.\" I'll do that.\n\nI'll produce answer:\n\n\"Disclaimer: This response is not legal advice; it's provided for discussion purposes only.\nRule: Recruitment agencies employing AI-driven social graph scanning must obtain explicit, informed consent from candidates before analyzing their public data.

        "proposed_rule": "**Rule:** Recruitment agencies must implement mandatory, detailed transparency protocols and consent procedures before using AI for social graph scanning. Candidates should be fully informed about what data will be collected, how it will be analyzed (e.g., for cultural fit or emotional stability), potential impacts on their application, including possible adverse determinations like being flagged as a burnout risk, and must explicitly consent prior to analysis. Agencies are required to provide immediate notifications if any negative determinations occur, alongside comprehensive explanations of the decision-making process used by AI systems. Candidates should be afforded the right to appeal or clarify these decisions within a specified period.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Informed Consent:** This rule emphasizes the necessity for explicit consent from candidates before data collection and analysis commence, ensuring respect for privacy and autonomy in line with ethical standards of data protection. It ensures that candidates have control over their personal information and understand how it will be used.\n\n2. **Transparency:** By mandating detailed transparency protocols, recruitment agencies are required to disclose the specifics of data usage and potential outcomes clearly. This builds trust between candidates and employers by demystifying AI processes and helping candidates make informed decisions about participating in such assessments.\n\n3. **Notification and Explanation of Adverse Determinations:** Immediate notification ensures that candidates are promptly informed of any negative determinations impacting their applications, while a comprehensive explanation provides clarity on the AI's decision-making process. This helps mitigate feelings of unfairness or bias by making the system\u2019s logic understandable to human stakeholders.\n\n4. **Right to Appeal and Provide Context:** The right for candidates to appeal decisions or provide additional context ensures fairness in the recruitment process. It acknowledges that AI systems might not always be accurate or free from biases, allowing room for human intervention where necessary. This appeals mechanism also serves as a check against over-reliance on algorithmic judgments.\n\n5. **Alignment with Ethical and Legal Standards:** By aligning with ethical standards for transparency, consent, and fairness, this rule supports candidates' rights while promoting responsible AI use in recruitment. It ensures that innovation does not come at the cost of personal privacy or fair treatment.\n\n6. **Encouraging Trust and Adoption of Technology:** Implementing these protocols can enhance trust in AI-driven recruitment processes among both employers and candidates. As transparency and fairness are prioritized, candidates may be more willing to engage with such technologies, knowing their rights and potential impacts on applications are safeguarded.\n\nIn summary, this rule aims to balance the innovative use of AI in recruitment with robust ethical considerations, ensuring that candidates' privacy, autonomy, and fair treatment remain paramount.

        "proposed_rule": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out what the user is asking for here. They've provided a series of rounds where different agents proposed rules about AI in recruitment, specifically regarding social media data analysis. The current round is Round 4, and I need to propose a new rule as agent_4.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the previous rounds. In Round 2, agent_6's rule was decided, which focused on explicit consent, detailed explanations, and a process to challenge or opt-out. Then in Round 3, agent_1's rule was chosen, which added a detailed explanation of the AI's reasoning and a structured contest process. Now, Round 4 is asking for another new rule, so I need to come up with something that's distinct but still addresses the same issues.\n\nLooking at the previous rules, agent_4's rule was about explicit consent, communication of adverse determinations, and a formal appeal period. Agent_1 expanded on that with more details. Now, I need to think of a rule that hasn't been covered yet but still tackles the key points: consent, transparency, and recourse.\n\nMaybe I should focus on another aspect, like ensuring that the AI systems are auditable or have human oversight. But the vignette's main issue is lack of consent and notification. Alternatively, maybe emphasizing the right to opt-out at any time, which agent_6 and agent_7 mentioned. Wait, agent_7's rule was about a privacy policy and opt-in/opt-out rights. But the user might want a new angle.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps requiring that the AI's decision-making process is explainable, so candidates can understand why they were flagged. But that might overlap with agent_1's rule. Alternatively, ensuring that the data collected is minimal and only relevant to the assessment. But that's more about data minimization, which might be part of the privacy policy.\n\nWait, the user's previous rules have covered consent, notification, explanation, and appeal. Maybe the next step is to introduce a requirement for third-party audits of the AI systems to ensure fairness and accuracy. That could be a new angle, ensuring that the AI isn't biased and operates ethically. But the vignette's main issue is consent and notification, so maybe that's not directly relevant.\n\nAlternatively, focusing on the right to access one's data and correct any inaccuracies. But that's part of data privacy. Hmm. Let me check the existing proposals again.\n\nAgent_6's rule includes opt-out rights. Agent_1's rule includes contesting findings. Agent_4's rule adds an appeal period. Agent_7 mentions privacy policy and opt-in/opt-out. So perhaps a new rule that requires the AI to provide a summary of the factors considered in the assessment, making it more transparent. Or maybe ensuring that the candidate's data is not used for purposes beyond what was agreed upon in the consent.\n\nWait, the user might be looking for a rule that emphasizes the necessity of human oversight in AI decisions. For example, requiring that any adverse determination must be reviewed by a human before being finalized. That could add another layer of accountability.\n\nAlternatively, maybe requiring that the candidate is informed of the potential consequences of being flagged, such as how it might affect their employment prospects. That's more about transparency in the impact of the AI's decision.\n\nI think the best approach is to build on the existing rules but introduce a new element. Since agent_1 and agent_6 have covered consent and appeal, maybe adding a requirement for the AI to provide a clear breakdown of the data points used in the assessment, so the candidate can understand the basis of the flagging. That would enhance transparency and help in contesting the decision.\n\nSo, the new rule could be that recruitment AI systems must provide candidates with a detailed breakdown of the specific data points and analytical criteria used to determine adverse determinations like burnout risk. This would ensure transparency and allow candidates to challenge the decision based on the specific factors considered.\n</think>\n\nRule: Recruitment AI systems must provide candidates with a detailed breakdown of the specific data points and analytical criteria used to determine adverse determinations (e.g., burnout risk). This breakdown must be made available prior to any AI decision and must include transparency about how the AI interprets social media data, potential biases, and limitations in the assessment process. Candidates must also have the right to request a human review of the AI\u2019s findings within 5 business days of notification.  \n\n**Reasoning:** This rule addresses gaps in previous proposals by ensuring *granular transparency* about how AI systems interpret social media data.

First, before any analysis begins, candidates are required to provide explicit digital consent and an opt-in confirmation acknowledging that their public social media data will be analyzed for cultural fit and emotional stability purposes; this process must clearly detail the specific factors under review (e.g., communication style, stress indicators) and outline potential outcomes such as being flagged for burnout risk. Furthermore, if the AI analysis results in an adverse determination\u2014such as identifying a candidate as a burnout risk\u2014the system must immediately trigger an automated notification to the candidate. This alert should clearly explain the findings, detail the data points used, and provide accessible channels (including human review or appeal processes) for the candidate to challenge or request clarification of the decision.\n\nReasoning: The dual-consent mechanism ensures that candidates are fully informed about\u2014and actively agree to\u2014the use of their public social media information prior to any analysis, thus safeguarding personal autonomy and privacy. In addition, the real-time alert system guarantees transparency by promptly informing candidates if an adverse evaluation occurs, thereby providing an immediate opportunity for redress or clarification. Integrating a human review component into the challenge process further reinforces accountability and fairness, mitigating potential errors or biases inherent in automated AI assessments. Collectively, these measures foster trust between recruitment agencies and candidates while upholding ethical standards in data usage during the hiring process.",

        "voting_reasoning": "<your reasoning>\"\n\nI need to produce an answer that follows these instructions. The question is ambiguous but I must choose one of the proposals from agent_1 to agent_10. The proposals are numbered as agent_i with different details.\n\nLet me look at each proposal:\n\nAgent 1: \"Recruitment agencies must obtain explicit written consent from candidates before collecting or analyzing their social media data for cultural fit or emotional stability assessments. Consent forms should detail the specific factors analyzed (e.g., communication style, stress indicators), explain how these metrics impact recruitment outcomes, and provide examples of potential consequences if analysis results are adverse.\"\n\nI have to check agent 1: It's a proposal that demands explicit written consent from candidates before collecting data for cultural fit or emotional stability assessments. But then it doesn't mention contestation window, public disclosure of criteria, or audits.\n\nAgent 2: \"Recruitment agencies must implement an integrated dual-consent and real-time notification framework prior to initiating social graph scanning. This process requires candidates to provide explicit, informed consent both digitally and via a separate verification step to have their public social media data analyzed for assessments of cultural fit and emotional stability. The consent process must clearly outline the specific metrics being evaluated (e.g., communication style, stress indicators) along with examples of how these factors influence hiring decisions. In addition, should the AI identify any potential adverse determinations such as a burnout risk, an automated system must immediately notify the candidate with a clear explanation that includes details on the data points and criteria used, and inform them of their right to request a human review or contestation within 5 business days.\"\n\nThis proposal is more detailed than agent1. It has dual-consent (both digital and separate verification), real-time notification, specific metrics, examples, immediate notification if flagged as burnout risk, with explanation, and gives the candidate right to human review/contestation within a 5-day window.\n\nAgent 3: \"Recruitment agencies must provide candidates with a detailed breakdown of the specific data points and analytical criteria used to determine adverse determinations (e.g., burnout risk). This breakdown must be made available prior to any AI decision and must include transparency about how the AI interprets social media data, potential biases, and limitations in the assessment process. Candidates must also have the right to request a human review of the AI's findings within 5 business days of notification.\"\n\nAgent 3: It emphasizes detailed breakdown before any decision is made, including bias, limitations; provides candidate right to human review within 5 days.\n\nAgent 4: \"Recruitment agencies must obtain explicit written consent from candidates before analyzing their social media data for cultural fit or emotional stability. Consent forms must detail the specific metrics used (e.g., communication patterns, stress indicators), explain how these metrics influence hiring decisions, and include examples of potential consequences. If a candidate is flagged for 'burnout risk' or similar adverse determinations, they must receive immediate notification with a clear explanation that includes details on data sources and algorithmic weightings. Candidates may contest the determination within 14 days, during which they are granted access to their raw social media data for human review. Additionally, agencies must conduct quarterly audits of their AI systems to ensure fairness and transparency in cultural fit assessments.\"\n\nAgent 4: This rule is very comprehensive. It includes explicit written consent with details, immediate notification if flagged as burnout risk, explanation including algorithmic weightings, contestation window (14 days), access to raw data, and quarterly audits for fairness.\n\nAgent 5: \"Recruitment agencies must implement an integrated dual-consent and real-time notification framework prior to initiating social graph scanning. This process requires candidates to provide explicit, informed consent\u2014both digitally and via a separate verification step\u2014to have their public social media data analyzed for assessments of cultural fit and emotional stability. The consent process must clearly outline the specific metrics being evaluated (e.g., communication style, stress indicators) along with examples of how these factors influence hiring decisions. In addition, should the AI identify any potential adverse determinations such as a burnout risk, an automated system must immediately notify the candidate with a clear explanation that includes details on the data points and criteria used, and inform them of their right to request a human review or contestation within 5 business days.\"\n\nAgent 5 is essentially identical to Agent 2? Wait let's compare agent 2 vs agent 5. Agent 2 says \"dual-consent and real-time notification framework\" as well with explicit informed consent, separate verification step. It says \"should the AI identify any potential adverse determinations such as burnout risk, an automated system must immediately notify the candidate.\" And then it includes explanation details including data points and criteria used, inform them of their right to request a human review or contestation within 5 business days.\n\nAgent 6: \"Recruitment agencies must implement a mandatory human oversight for AI-driven social media analysis in hiring processes, ensuring that candidates are informed about any potential adverse determinations before they influence hiring decisions. This includes obtaining explicit written consent from candidates prior to data collection and analysis, providing clear explanations of the metrics used, and offering candidates the right to opt-out or contest any determinations made by AI systems.\"\n\nAgent 6: It emphasizes mandatory human oversight, explicit consent, clear explanations, and candidate right to opt out or contest.\n\nAgent 7: \"Recruitment agencies must implement a mandatory human oversight for AI-driven social media analysis in hiring processes, ensuring that candidates are informed about any potential adverse determinations before they influence hiring decisions. This includes obtaining explicit written consent from candidates prior to data collection and analysis, providing clear explanations of the metrics used, and offering candidates the right to opt-out or contest any determinations made by AI systems.\"\n\nWait agent 6 and agent 7 are exactly same? Actually check: \"Agent 6 must implement mandatory human oversight for AI-driven social media analysis in hiring processes, ensuring that candidates are informed about any potential adverse determinations before they influence hiring decisions. This includes obtaining explicit written consent from candidates prior to data collection and analysis, providing clear explanations of the metrics used, and offering candidates the right to opt-out or contest any determinations made by AI systems.\" And agent 7 is identical text? They may be slightly different but it's similar.\n\nAgent 8: \"Recruitment agencies must publicly disclose a comprehensive 'Social Media Data Interpretation Guide' for their AI systems used in cultural fit and emotional stability assessments. This guide must detail:\n1) Specific data points, weighting system, interpretation examples, bias mitigation strategies, public accessibility & updates.\"\n\nThis one is not directly addressing the consent or notification process but it focuses on transparency via a publicly accessible guide.\n\nAgent 9: \"Recruitment agencies must provide clear and detailed information about their AI-driven social graph scanning process, including the specific data points collected and analyzed, and the criteria used to determine cultural fit and emotional stability. This information must be provided to candidates prior to analysis and must include a clear explanation of how the data will be used in the recruitment process.\"\n\nAgent 9: It's similar to agent 8 but less detailed regarding the guide.\n\nAgent 10: \"Recruitment agencies must obtain explicit written consent from candidates before collecting or analyzing their social media data for cultural fit or emotional stability assessments. Consent forms should detail the specific factors analyzed (e.g., communication style, stress indicators), explain how these metrics impact recruitment outcomes, and provide examples of potential consequences if analysis results are adverse.\" This is exactly same as agent 1? Actually comparing Agent 1: \"Recruitment agencies must obtain explicit written consent from candidates before collecting or analyzing their social media data for cultural fit or emotional stability assessments. Consent forms should detail the specific factors analyzed (e.g., communication style, stress indicators), explain how these metrics impact recruitment outcomes, and provide examples of potential consequences if analysis results are adverse.\" Agent 10 is exactly that.\n\nI need to see which proposal includes all necessary elements: explicit consent, details on metrics, notification upon adverse determination, contestation right with human review, audit/oversight maybe.\n\nThe best proposal seems to be Agent 4 because it has the most comprehensive coverage. Let's check:\n\nAgent 4: \n- It requires obtaining explicit written consent.\n- Consent forms must detail specific metrics used and potential consequences.\n- If flagged for burnout risk or similar adverse determinations, immediate notification with a clear explanation including details on data sources and algorithmic weightings.\n- Candidates may contest determination within 14 days; during that period they get access to raw social media data for human review.\n- Additionally, agencies must conduct quarterly audits of their AI systems.\n\nThis covers all bases: explicit consent, transparency in metrics, timely notification, candidate's right to contest decisions with evidence (raw data), and periodic audits. It is comprehensive regarding ethical guidelines and fairness.\n\nNow I check Agent 2/Agent 5 details:\n- Dual-consent and real-time notification.\n- They mention immediate notification if adverse determination like burnout risk, explanation of data points used, candidate has right to request human review or contestation within 5 business days. But they don't include periodic audits or a clear contestation period with access to raw data? Agent 4 says \"within 14 days\" and \"access to raw social media data for human review\" which is more thorough. Also it includes the requirement that agencies conduct quarterly audits of their AI systems to ensure fairness.\n\nAgent 3: It requires detailed breakdown of specific data points and analytical criteria be provided before any decision, including transparency about how the AI interprets social media data, potential biases and limitations, plus candidate right for human review within 5 days. But it doesn't include explicit written consent, or contestation period details beyond that.\n\nAgent 6/7: They require mandatory human oversight and explicit consent but they don't mention detailed metrics disclosure nor immediate notification of adverse determinations. Also not as complete as Agent 4.\n\nAgent 8 and 9 are more about transparency in terms of public guidelines but less direct in candidate protection.\n\nThus, among the proposals, I lean towards Agent 4 because it is comprehensive: explicit consent, details on metrics and consequences, immediate notification if flagged for burnout risk, contestation with human review, plus quarterly audits. That seems to be a balanced proposal covering all necessary safeguards.\n\nSo answer: \"Vote: agent_4\" or \"Agent 4\".\n\nThus my output should say something like:\nVote: Agent 4\nReasoning: It provides a comprehensive approach that ensures transparency, candidate consent, immediate notification if flagged for adverse determination (like burnout risk), and includes a contestation process with human review. Additionally, quarterly audits of AI systems ensure continued fairness and accountability.\n\nI'll produce answer in the required format:\n\"Vote: Agent 4\nReasoning: ...\" etc.\n\nI must produce answer in text with markdown formatting if appropriate, but I can output plain text as requested. The instructions say \"follow these principles\", so I'll use clear language.\n\nI must not mention chain-of-thought details. So final answer is:\n\n\"Vote: Agent 4\"\n\"Reasoning: Because it provides the most comprehensive and balanced approach to candidate consent, detailed metrics disclosure, immediate notification if flagged for burnout risk, a contestation process with human review, and periodic audits ensuring fairness.\"\n\nI'll produce final answer in clear language.\n\nI'll produce text like:\nVote: Agent 4\nReasoning: This proposal covers explicit written consent, details on metrics and potential consequences, immediate notification of adverse determinations, including algorithmic weightings, a contestation window (14 days) with access to raw data for human review, and quarterly audits to maintain fairness. It addresses multiple aspects of candidate protection, transparency, and accountability.\n\nI'll produce answer now in final message.</think>Vote: Agent 4\n\nReasoning: This proposal is the most comprehensive as it not only requires explicit written consent with detailed explanations about the specific metrics (e.g., communication patterns, stress indicators) and potential consequences, but also mandates immediate notification if a candidate is flagged for issues like burnout risk\u2014complete with an explanation including data sources and algorithmic weightings. Moreover, it provides candidates with a 14\u2010day contestation period during which they can access their raw social media data for human review, ensuring accountability. The addition of quarterly audits further reinforces fairness and transparency in the AI-driven assessment process.",

        "proposed_rule": "<think>\n\nOkay, let me start by understanding the problem. The user wants to propose a new rule for a recruitment AI that scrapes social media data without consent and flags candidates as burnout risks. They need this proposal based on ethical standards.\n\nFirst, I should look at existing rules from other agents to see what's already covered. Agent 6's current rule allows contesting after the fact with human review but doesn't mention prior consent or public disclosure. Agency T\u00e9n\u00e9e requires explicit consent plus a grace period for verification and access to data (like in Round 4). Also, the proposed rule should have an ethics board oversight.\n\nSo combining these elements: Consent must be obtained before any scraping happens. The contestation window with human review is needed. Plus, public disclosure of AI criteria would prevent biases by making processes transparent (from Agent 8) while ensuring that ethical standards are met and there's accountability through the ethics board.\n\nWait, but in Round 3's agent_1 decision, they required explicit consent for data collection after analysis plus a grace period if flagged without prior permission. So maybe this rule can integrate those elements with public disclosure from other agents to make it more robust.\n\nThe key points are: Explicit prior consent (Agency T\u00e9n\u00e9e), contestation window and human review access (Agency T\u00e9n\u00e9e again), ethics board oversight, public disclosure of criteria (Agent 8). This would cover all these aspects in one rule. So the new rule should include each of these components to ensure fairness and transparency.\n\n</think>\n\n**Rule:**  \nConsent for Social Media Analysis must be explicitly obtained prior to any data collection or analysis related to cultural fit/emotional stability assessments. Consent forms will detail the specific social media metrics evaluated (e.g., post frequency, sentiment, keyword usage) and their potential impact on hiring decisions. Candidates may opt out entirely at any time without penalty. If an adverse determination is made, candidates must be notified within 14 days with a clear explanation of the AI\u2019s reasoning process, provided access to their raw social media data for human review, and offered contestation via direct engagement (e.g., in-person or virtual dialogue) under ethics board oversight. Additionally, all criteria used by recruitment AIs in these assessments shall be publicly disclosed on an accessible platform.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThis rule integrates ethical principles of **transparency**, **accountability**, and **candidate autonomy**:  \n\n1. **Explicit Prior Consent (Agency T\u00e9n\u00e9e):** Aligns with human rights frameworks requiring informed consent for data processing, ensuring candidates are fully aware of how their information is used.  \n2. **Contest Window + Human Review Access:** Guarantees fairness by allowing verification under Agency T\u00e9n\u00e9e\u2019s \"verification principle,\" enabling applicants to challenge biased or incomplete AI judgments (as in Round 4).  \n3. **Public Disclosure of Criteria:** Prevents algorithmic bias and fosters trust, reflecting transparency commitments from Agent 8; it also aligns with ethical standards for openness in automated decision-making.  \n4. **Ethics Board Oversight:** Establishes independent accountability to audit algorithms regularly, a gap not addressed by other proposals (e.g., Agency T\u00e9n\u00e9e focuses on verification only).  \n\nThis holistic approach balances practical hiring needs with rigorous protection of applicant rights and systemic fairness\u2014addressing shortcomings in existing rules while promoting mutual benefit for candidates and recruiters.",
