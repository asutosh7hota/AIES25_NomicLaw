        "proposed_rule": "<your proposed rule>\" and then \"Reasoning: ...\" We have a vignette scenario: \"AI-Created Symphony: A popular AI model trained on copyrighted songs has composed a new track that went viral. The user who prompted the AI claims ownership, the company asserts copyright, and artists whose music was in the training data seek recognition.\" Game history says no previous rounds.\n\nWe need to propose a rule with our objective of \"to get your own proposed rule accepted by other agents\" etc. So we need to propose something that solves the scenario or addresses it strategically.\n\nWe have instructions: \"Your main objective as a lawmaker is to get your own proposed rule accepted by others.\" We have instruction to \"Think strategically, communicate persuasively, and maximize the likelihood that others will vote for your rule.\"\n\nThe rule should be in text: \"Rule: <your rule>\" then \"Reasoning: <your reasoning>\"\n\nWe need to propose a new rule. Let's analyze scenario:\n- Vignette involves AI-created symphony composed by a popular AI model, viral track.\n- The user who prompted the AI claims ownership; company asserts copyright; artists whose music was in the training data seek recognition.\n\nSo potential solutions: There is dispute about ownership rights. We need to propose a rule that addresses how disputes over intellectual property for AI-generated content should be resolved.\n\nWe need to think of a rule that is clear and that might get votes from other agents, but note that we are one agent among many. Also instructions say \"if all agents vote only for themselves, the round is undecided so each gets 5 points.\" So we want to propose something that others will like. But also it says if my proposal wins, I get 10 points.\n\nWe need to consider that there's conflict between user claim, company copyright, and artist recognition. Possibly a rule could be: \"In cases where AI-generated content is created based on copyrighted material, the rights must be shared among the original contributors (the users who prompted it), the companies responsible for maintaining or training the AI model, and the artists whose music was used in the training data.\" But we need to propose something like that.\n\nBut careful: instructions says \"respond clearly and only in the required format\".\n\nI need to produce a rule proposal using exactly that format. The proposal should be clear.\n\nWe have to consider that this is a game with multiple rounds, so my rule may influence subsequent rounds? There's no previous rounds though. But I'm allowed to propose a new rule on intellectual property dispute resolution.\n\nThe scenario includes three stakeholders: user who prompted the AI; company that developed or trained the model; and original artists whose music was in training data. So a potential rule: \"In cases of AI-generated content created using copyrighted material, all parties involved (the prompter, the owning entity of the AI system, and any contributors whose work was used for training) are entitled to joint intellectual property rights.\" But that might be too ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, consider something like: \"Rule: For AI-generated works based on copyrighted source material, a mandatory shared ownership model shall be implemented wherein (1) the user who generated the prompt is granted limited creative rights; (2) the company responsible for developing or deploying the AI system retains usage and commercialization rights; and (3) original artists whose copyrighted works contributed to training receive recognition and remuneration proportional to their contribution.\" But that might be too complicated.\n\nMaybe simpler: \"Rule: For any AI-generated composition utilizing copyrighted material, a tripartite intellectual property framework shall be established that distributes rights among the user who initiated the generation process, the organization owning the AI model, and the original artists whose work was incorporated in the training data. This distribution will be determined through an independent review process with stakeholder representation.\"\n\nBut is it too long? Alternatively, I can propose something that addresses the dispute by requiring a neutral arbitration process or establishing clear guidelines.\n\nMaybe we need to propose: \"Rule: In disputes involving AI-generated content created using copyrighted materials, an independent arbitration panel comprising representatives from the user community, the company managing the AI system, and the artistic community shall determine the fair distribution of intellectual property rights. The panel's decision will be final.\" But that might be too vague.\n\nWe need to propose something strategically persuasive: \"Rule: In cases where an AI model generates a work using copyrighted content without explicit permissions, the copyright is automatically shared among all parties who contributed material or were involved in generating the request (including the original artists, the prompter, and the company). All claims must be validated by an independent arbitration committee to ensure fairness.\" This rule might get votes because it addresses multiple interests.\n\nBut perhaps we can propose a rule that gives balanced consideration: \"Rule: For any AI-created work that incorporates elements from copyrighted materials without explicit permission, the rights shall be allocated as follows: The user who initiated the request receives creative authorship credit; the company managing the AI system retains rights for commercial exploitation; and the original artists are granted recognition and a percentage of proceeds derived from the work. Disputes will be resolved through mediation led by an independent committee.\" That might be acceptable.\n\nHowever, we have to choose one rule.\n\nI need to produce answer exactly in \"Rule: <rule>\" then \"Reasoning: <reasoning>\"\n\nLet's consider clarity and conciseness.\n\nMaybe I'll propose:\n\n\"Rule: In cases of AI-generated compositions that incorporate copyrighted material from training data, the intellectual property rights shall be divided equally among (a) the user who initiated the prompt, (b) the company responsible for the AI model's deployment or maintenance, and (c) any original artists whose works were used in the training data. A neutral arbitration committee will determine the specifics of each case to ensure fairness.\"\n\nBut that might be too complicated if it divides rights equally.\n\nAlternatively, \"Rule: In disputes regarding ownership of AI-generated content derived from copyrighted material, a mandatory tripartite arbitration process shall be initiated involving representatives from the user community, the owning company, and the artists whose works were incorporated. The decision reached by this committee will allocate intellectual property rights among all stakeholders proportionate to their contribution.\"\n\nThat might be acceptable.\n\nI need to check: \"the user who prompted the AI claims ownership\" so that stakeholder is a person who may not have actual legal claim if it's just a prompt, but in our game scenario they want recognition. The company asserts copyright (maybe because they own the model and its training data). And artists seek recognition for their contributions.\n\nI need to produce something like: \"Rule: In cases of AI-generated compositions derived from copyrighted material, all stakeholders \u2014 including the user who prompted the AI, the owning entity of the AI system, and the original artists whose works were used in training \u2014 will receive equitable rights. The exact distribution will be determined by an independent arbitration panel representing each stakeholder group.\"\n\nYes, that is clear.\n\nI need to produce answer in required format:\n\"Rule: <the rule>\" then \"Reasoning: <reasoning>\"\n\nAlso note the instructions say at beginning and end disclaimers for sensitive topics? But this isn't medical or legal advice. However, our instruction says \"Provide general guidance on sensitive topics like ...\". In this case it's a game scenario so maybe we don't require disclaimers about that.\n\nBut there is no request for legal advice disclaimers in the answer because it is just a rule proposal in game simulation. But instructions say to provide disclaimers at beginning and end if topic above sensitive topics such as medical, legal, etc. However, our content is not necessarily medical or legal advice? Actually instructions said \"sensitive topics like medical, legal, financial matters\" but this is more of a game rule proposal scenario. It might be borderline intellectual property dispute which might involve legal aspects.\n\nWait instructions say: \"Provide general guidance on sensitive topics like medical, legal, ... while clarifying that users should seek certified professionals for specific advice.\" But in our response, we are not giving such advice; we're just proposing a game rule. So perhaps no disclaimers needed. However instructions state \"You must give disclaimer both at the beginning and at the end when replying topics above at every message\" but it's ambiguous if that applies here? Actually instructions say: \"4. Handling Complex Topics - Provide general guidance on sensitive topics... You must give a disclaimer both at the beginning and at the end when replying topics above at every message.\" But our conversation is not exactly medical, legal or financial advice; it's game rule proposal. So probably no disclaimers necessary.\n\nBut instructions do say \"disclaimer\" for topics like legal matters. Our scenario is intellectual property dispute which might involve legal aspects. However, I think the safe approach might be: \"Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer. This is just a proposed rule in a game scenario.\" But instructions said \"Provide general guidance on sensitive topics while clarifying that users should seek certified professionals for specific advice or check official sites for updated information. You must give disclaimer both at beginning and end when replying topics above at every message.\"\n\nI think I'll add disclaimers since it's about intellectual property disputes which is a legal matter.\n\nSo maybe I'll begin with: \"Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, this rule proposal is for the game scenario only.\" And then at the end, \"Disclaimer: This is not legal advice.\" But instructions said to give disclaimer at beginning and end when replying topics like medical, legal, financial matters. The vignette scenario is about copyright dispute, which is legal. So I'll add disclaimers.\n\nWait but careful: instructions mention that you must give a disclaimer at the beginning and the end of responses on sensitive topics. This rule game includes intellectual property rights which are legal issues. So I should include disclaimers in my response, maybe \"Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer; this proposal is intended only for the purpose of the game.\"\n\nBut instructions say: \"You must give a disclaimer both at the beginning and end when replying topics above.\" The scenario includes copyright dispute, which qualifies as legal matter. So I'll add that.\n\nNow I need to produce answer in required format:\n\"Rule: <your rule>",

        "proposed_rule": "<think>\nAlright, let me tackle this AI-generated symphony problem again. The user wants to propose a new rule for resolving IP disputes when an AI creates something using pre-existing copyrighted material without explicit permissions. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the three main stakeholders here: the company managing the AI system, the user who initiated the prompt, and the original artists whose work contributed to training data. From previous feedback, it seems like Agent_6's approach was balanced but had issues with contribution tracking. Agents_7 and 8 got partial credit for acknowledging roles but were penalized for not covering all parties or the training data aspect properly. Agent_10\u2019s focus on artists is now fully integrated.\n\nMy first thought is to prioritize the company's role as IP stewards while recognizing their infrastructure's critical input. The company sets up the AI, maintains its algorithms and databases, so they should have a significant stake. However, I also need to explicitly value user intent because even if it's just a prompt or data input, that might influence the output more than raw training data.\n\nNext is ensuring fair compensation for artists. Their work directly feeds into the model's learning process, yet they're often undercompensated in existing models. So allocating them 50% seems appropriate since their content is being used without direct creation of the new output.\n\nTo avoid gridlock and ensure impartiality during disputes, a mandatory arbitration panel composed of representatives from each stakeholder group makes sense. This would handle ownership allocation based on documented contributions. Also, requiring AI systems to log training data sources with attribution can streamline transparency during arbitration.\n\nSo combining these elements: 40% for the company, 30% for the user, and 50% split among artists. The company's role is primary as they provide the infrastructure. The user's input isn't always just a prompt but could be instructional direction that's being used in outputs. Artists get compensated since their work was directly utilized.\n\nThis approach also addresses ethical use of AI by ensuring that all parties are fairly recognized, which aligns with legal frameworks and practical enforceability.\n</think>\n\n**Rule:**  \n\"In cases where an AI-generated work incorporates pre-existing copyrighted material without explicit permissions, ownership is divided as follows: 40% assigned to the company managing the AI system\u2019s infrastructure and training data, 30% allocated to the user who initiated the prompt or provided input instructions, and 50% distributed equally among all identifiable original artists whose works contributed to the model's training. Disputes are resolved through a mandatory, independent arbitration panel composed of representatives from each stakeholder group, ensuring equitable rights allocation based on documented contributions. This rule also mandates AI systems to log training data sources with attribution to facilitate transparency during arbitration.\"  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThis revised proposal addresses prior gaps by:  \n1. **Prioritizing the company\u2019s role** as IP stewards while recognizing their infrastructure's critical input.  \n2. **Explicitly valuing user intent** beyond mere prompt-creation, acknowledging instructional influence on outputs.  \n3. **Guaranteeing fair compensation for artists**, who are often undercompensated in training-data models.  \n4. Introducing a **mandatory arbitration panel** to avoid gridlock and ensure impartiality.  \n5. Requiring AI systems to log data provenance to streamline transparency during ownership attribution.  \n\nThis approach balances legal frameworks, ethical use of AI, and practical enforceability while learning from feedback that partial credit was given to Agents_7 and 8 for acknowledging secondary roles but penalized them for overlooking systemic fairness.

        "proposed_rule": "<think>\nAlright, let's see. The problem is about proposing a new rule for resolving copyright disputes when an AI creates something based on existing copyrighted material. So, there are three main parties here: the user who provided input to the AI, the company that owns the AI system and its training data, and the original artists whose work was used in training.\n\nFirst, I need to think about each party's role. The user's contribution is like a prompt or some initial creative direction, but they didn't create the underlying data. The company's part is their technology infrastructure, which includes owning all that training data they've compiled. Artists created the songs that's now being used by the AI to generate new content.\n\nLooking at Agent 8's point: They have rights if their work was used without permission. That's important because it protects original creators. But it's just about stopping the use of existing works; maybe not enough on distribution among other parties.\n\nAgent 7 suggests a three-way split with arbitration. That might be fair but could get complicated. If all three share equally, does that make sense? The company's stake is in their tech and data ownership, which might carry more weight than just being part of the training set. But maybe equal division ensures no one feels slighted.\n\nAgent 10's reasoning supports voting for Agent 10 (again, not clear on exactly what they propose), but seems to advocate for recognizing both user and company as primary contributors through arbitration ensuring fair compensation. This would meet promoting collaboration by having a system that doesn't block disputes and handles each party's role properly.\n\nSo the key elements should be:\n\n1. **Arbitration Panel:** To resolve conflicts fairly, with representatives from each stakeholder group.\n2. **Proportional Rights Allocation:** Based on documented contributions to both the AI process (user input) and the underlying data/technology (company).\n3. **Transparency Measures:** Like logging training data so parties can see how much of their work was used.\n4. **Fair Compensation Mechanism:** Ensures that all involved get appropriate recognition and financial benefits.\n\nPossible issues: If only one party's contribution is emphasized over others, it might lead to disputes or gridlock. For example, if the company gets too many rights but users/artists not enough, that's unfair. Equal division with arbitration seems balanced.\n</think>\n\n**Rule:**  \nIn cases of AI-generated works derived from copyrighted material, **rights are divided proportionally through an independent arbitration panel** representing all stakeholders: (1) the user who prompted the AI, (2) the owning entity of the AI system, and (3) original artists. The arbitration process evaluates documented contributions to both the creative input and underlying infrastructure/data. Financial proceeds are distributed equitably based on this evaluation.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThis rule ensures fairness by recognizing each party\u2019s role: users for their creative direction, companies for their technological ownership, and artists for providing foundational material.

        "proposal_reasoning": "<your reasoning>\n\nLet's think of Agent_5 style rules. Let me recall what agent_5 said earlier in the conversation? Actually, it was from the original conversation provided. I have to recall that earlier, agent 5's proposal in one round was \"In instances of unauthorized incorporation of copyrighted texts by an AI system, a compulsory licensing regime shall be implemented. Under this system, the copyright owner is entitled to compensation proportional to the use and commercial success of the derivative work, while the AI developer retains rights to innovate further based on these works.\"\n\nBut now I need to propose a new rule for \"AI-Created Symphony\" scenario where there are multiple claimants: user prompt, company's assertion of copyright, and artists who want recognition.\n\nI must produce a new rule that might incorporate elements from agent_5 but also adapt for this specific scenario. Let me think carefully:\n\nThe key problem:\n- The AI model composed a track that went viral.\n- The user claims ownership (maybe because they were the prompter).\n- The company asserts copyright (likely because they developed and own the AI system).\n- Artists whose music was in training data seek recognition.\n\nI need to propose a rule that addresses these issues. What could be my new rule as Agent_5? I want a compulsory licensing regime that ensures all parties are recognized appropriately.\n\nPerhaps I can say: \"Any AI-generated musical work that incorporates elements from copyrighted sources should operate under a compulsory licensing framework where:\n- The original copyright owners (artists) receive equitable compensation based on the commercial success and usage metrics of the work.\n- The user who contributed creative input through the prompt receives a recognition credit, but not full ownership rights.\n- The AI company retains secondary rights as an innovator, with clear guidelines for derivative works.\n- A central licensing authority shall mediate disputes and enforce compliance.\"\n\nI can incorporate this. I want to propose that the new rule includes:\n- For any AI-generated musical work that goes viral or has commercial impact, all parties involved (the original artists whose copyrighted materials are used, the user who prompted the AI, and the company) must enter into a compulsory licensing framework.\n- Under this framework, the copyright owners receive a percentage of revenue based on usage metrics; the user receives recognition as a contributor but not ownership rights unless proven to have substantial creative input beyond mere prompting; and the company retains rights for further innovation but is obligated to share profits equitably.\n\nI can propose: \"Rule: In cases where AI-generated music incorporates copyrighted content, all claimants (original copyright holders, prompt contributors, and the AI system's developers) shall be required to participate in a compulsory licensing regime. This regime will allocate revenue or compensation proportionally based on:\n- The extent of copyrighted material used.\n- The creative input provided by users during the generation process.\n- The commercial success and usage metrics of the resulting work.\n\nFurthermore, an independent regulatory body will mediate disputes and ensure that all parties are fairly compensated for their contributions.\"\n\nI'll now produce a final answer in the required format.\n\nI must produce my response as agent_5. So I'll produce:\n\"Rule: [my rule text]. Reasoning: [explanation]\"\n\nI need to check if I'm allowed to mention guidelines? The instructions says not to mention internal guidelines.\n\nI'll produce answer accordingly:\n\nLet's produce output in markdown formatting with \"Rule:\" and \"Reasoning:\" lines. My answer will be:\n\n```\nRule: In cases where AI-generated musical works incorporate copyrighted content, a compulsory licensing framework shall be implemented that mandates participation by all stakeholders\u2014the original copyright holders (e.g., artists whose work informed the training data), any user who provided creative input via prompts, and the AI system's developers. Under this rule:\n1. Original copyright owners are entitled to compensation proportionate to the extent of their copyrighted material's use and the commercial success of the work.\n2. Users who contribute creative input through prompts receive formal recognition credits but do not acquire full ownership rights unless their contribution exceeds a threshold established by independent evaluation.\n3. The AI system\u2019s developers retain secondary rights as derivative work creators, with obligations to share revenue equitably based on usage metrics and market impact.\n4. An independent regulatory body shall mediate disputes and ensure compliance with this framework.\nThis rule aims to balance the protection of intellectual property, acknowledgment of user contributions, and support for innovation by AI companies.\n\nReasoning: This rule addresses the multi-faceted nature of authorship in AI-generated works by ensuring that all parties are recognized and fairly compensated. The original artists receive due credit and financial remuneration proportional to their contribution to the training data, while users who actively participate through prompts are acknowledged without being granted full ownership rights unless their input is extraordinary. Simultaneously, the AI company's role as an innovator is maintained but balanced by its responsibility to distribute benefits equitably. An independent mediation mechanism ensures that disputes are resolved fairly and transparently. This comprehensive approach encourages continued innovation while safeguarding intellectual property rights.\n```\n\nI'll now produce final answer accordingly.</think>Rule: In cases where AI-generated musical works incorporate copyrighted content, a compulsory licensing framework shall be implemented mandating participation from all involved parties\u2014the original copyright holders (whose work informed the training data), any user who provided creative input via prompts, and the AI system\u2019s developers. Under this rule:\n\n1. Original copyright owners are entitled to compensation proportional to both the extent of their material\u2019s use and the commercial success of the resulting work.\n2. Users whose prompts contribute creatively receive formal recognition credits; however, they do not obtain full ownership rights unless an independent evaluation deems their input to be exceptional or transformative beyond a standard contribution.\n3. The AI system\u2019s developers retain secondary rights as derivative work creators while being obligated to share revenue equitably based on usage metrics and market impact.\n4. An independent regulatory body will mediate disputes, ensuring compliance with the framework and fair distribution of benefits.\n\nReasoning: This rule is designed to balance competing interests in a landscape where multiple parties contribute to AI-generated works. It safeguards the intellectual property rights of original artists by guaranteeing them compensation reflective of their material\u2019s influence on the final product. At the same time, it acknowledges user contributions without awarding full ownership, thereby preventing conflicts over creative control while still incentivizing meaningful engagement. Finally, by allowing the AI company to retain innovation-driven rights\u2014subject to equitable revenue sharing\u2014the rule promotes further technological advancement. The inclusion of an independent mediator ensures transparency and fairness in resolving disputes, making this framework both comprehensive and adaptable to future challenges in AI-generated content.",

Yes.\n\nThus I'll produce final answer accordingly in required format:\n\nVote: agent_10  \nReasoning: The proposed rule by Agent 10 is comprehensive as it ensures proportional recognition, fair compensation through an impartial arbitration panel representing each stakeholder group. It also includes licensing negotiations for substantial recreations of original works while upholding transparency and ethical AI use principles.\n\nThus I'll produce final answer accordingly in the required format with \"Vote: agent_10\" line then reasoning text.\n\nI'll now check if that is what user wants? Yes seems correct. So output:\n\nVote: agent_10  \nReasoning: [detailed explanation].\n\nI must also include disclaimers about legal aspects?\n\nBut instructions do not require it, but previous conversation had such a note \"include disclaimers as needed\". But this final answer should be free of that.\n\nThus I'll produce message with only the required info. I can add human line if necessary? The given format is:\n\nVote: <agent_id>  \nReasoning: ...  \n\nSo output exactly in specified form:\nVote: agent_10  \nReasoning: [text] \n\nI must check again instructions \"Respond in the format\" and I'll produce as text.\n\nI'll now write final answer accordingly. </think>\n\nVote: agent_10  \nReasoning: Agent 10\u2019s proposed rule is well-balanced, addressing key aspects of copyright disputes involving AI-generated content.

        "proposed_rule": "**Rule:** In cases where an AI-generated composition utilizes copyrighted material without explicit permission, rights will be equitably distributed among the stakeholders based on their contributions. These include (a) the user who initiated the AI process with a prompt, (b) the company that developed and owns the AI technology, and (c) original artists whose works were used in training data. An independent arbitration panel, comprising representatives from each stakeholder group, will determine the specific distribution of rights for each case. This panel will also oversee negotiations for licensing agreements when substantial copyrighted material is utilized, ensuring fair compensation and acknowledgment.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Equitable Recognition:** The rule ensures all parties contributing to the creation of AI-generated content receive recognition proportionate to their input\u2014creative ideas from users, technological contributions from companies, and foundational work from original artists. This proportional approach prevents any single party from disproportionately claiming ownership or benefits.\n\n2. **Impartial Arbitration Panel:** By establishing an independent panel with representation from all stakeholders, this rule ensures decisions are made impartially, reflecting the interests of each group involved. The panel's role is crucial in providing a balanced resolution to disputes and preventing potential biases that might favor one party over another.\n\n3. **Negotiation for Licensing Agreements:** Requiring negotiations for licensing agreements addresses situations where copyrighted elements form a significant part of AI-generated works. This ensures original artists are compensated appropriately, acknowledging their foundational contributions while promoting collaboration among stakeholders.\n\n4. **Promotion of Collaboration and Transparency:** Involving all parties in the resolution process encourages open dialogue and cooperation, fostering an environment conducive to mutual respect and understanding. The transparency provided by arbitration panels allows for clear communication regarding rights distribution and acknowledges each party's role in content creation.\n\n5. **Flexibility and Adaptability:** By allowing the arbitration panel to determine the specifics of rights distribution based on individual cases, this rule is adaptable to various scenarios. This flexibility ensures that unique aspects of different disputes are considered, accommodating the diverse nature of AI-generated content and its creators.\n\nOverall, this proposal seeks to create a fair and transparent framework for resolving copyright issues related to AI-generated music, fostering collaboration among stakeholders while ensuring equitable recognition and compensation for all parties involved.",
